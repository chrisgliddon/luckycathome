If you have, there's a big chance you've seen that adorable waving cat figurine quietly perched on the counter. Many people know this as the Lucky Cat or the Fortune Cat, but it actually has a name - it's Maneki Neko (招き猫).</p><p></p><p></p><p>Aside from being a symbol of fortune, there's actually more to this cat than most people know. And being a curious cat myself, I decided to dig deeper into this cute kitty of luck. Join me as we learn more of Maneki Neko, and see how it helps one attract good fortune.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>What is Maneki-Neko?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Maneki Neko is a Japanese phrase that literally translates as "beckoning cat." Traditionally, it depicts a calico Japanese Bobtail cat and is often believed to bring good luck to the owner. You'll commonly see this cat figurine with one paw raised in the air as if it's waving.</p><p></p><p></p><p>These figurines are commonly displayed in shops and other businesses because they are known to bring good luck and attract more customers. Hence, the name Lucky Cat, Fortune Cat, Money Cat, etc.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Brief History</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The origins of Maneki-Neko goes back to the <strong>Edo Period</strong> in Japan (17th century to the mid-19th century). There are many famous legends about the origins of the Maneki Neko. Still, the most popular one is said to be about a wealthy lord named Ii Naotaka.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/11/JkSDkKaCYOUFdcaukvPU72bzSGizrU7z07LN_5TviS7o1qDWvpyKHB7XSVwo6sEGn2XWYEMoR0feZmgo09WBe9V2ZDxVJjzTAL8yo3wd_KTKcemTuY57HBlA34aEnu6CoFjT1iS1" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>According to the legends, Ii Naotaka tried to shelter himself from the rain by going under a tree near the Gotoku-Ji temple. Lord Ii saw the priest's cat, named Hanako, beckoning at him and decided to follow him to the temple.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Just then, a strong lightning bolt struck the tree he took shelter in only moments earlier. Moved by his luck, Lord Ii was so thankful for the cat that had saved his life befriended the priest. Lord Ii became a benefactor of the temple and brought much prosperity to Gotoku-Ji with his gifts.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When Hanako passed away, they buried him in a special graveyard for cats. In the temple, a Maneki-Neko statue was made to commemorate this special cat and has been revered ever since.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> The Gotoku-Ji Temple, located in the Setagaya ward of Tokyo, is known as the birthplace on Maneki-Neko, and when you decide to visit this temple in Japan, you'll see tons of this Maneki-Neko figurines in one corner of the temple. They come in different sizes too.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Tourists can even buy a lucky cat figurine, make a wish or prayer for good luck on it, and leave it on the temple with the rest of the figurines. You can also take them home and keep them until the wish has been fulfilled. When that happens, it is advised to go back to Gotokuji and put the cat figurine back at the temple to give thanks.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>How to pronounce Maneki-Neko?</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Maneki-Neko (招き猫) is a Japanese term and is pronounced as:</p><p></p><p></p><p>招 (mahne) き (keeh) 猫 (nehko).</p><p></p><p></p><p>Or</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ma-Neh-Key Neh-Ko.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Not</p><p></p><p></p><p>Man-e-key Knee-ko.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Is Maneki Neko Chinese or Japanese?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Because of its popularity in the Chinese community, Maneki-Neko is often mistaken to be of Chinese origin. It was even known as the 'Chinese Lucky Cat' or jīnmāo ("golden cat").</p><p></p><p></p><p>But that's not true. Maneki-Neko <strong>originated in Japan, not China</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/11/PmbVcLzbV3evpPKIwYAm3n7csDM1C0k3NLjAgUfHl7H_vyH-dbGiKB4EQ4WnKEontbtNgcUZtycrQ_G1jsMDbHHMmuS_pH394BTQ2AtLnqbhdm1Z8viGKMOjv4KPSemBfZbFa8Rd" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>This lucky cat somehow reached the straights of China, where it became popular with many businesses. There was even an old Chinese proverb saying that if a cat washes its face, it will rain. Thus, there is a possibility that the belief of a cat washing its face would bring in customers was brought by this proverb.</p><p></p><p></p><p>China's Tang Dynasty author, Duan Chengshi, wrote in his Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang: "If a cat raises its paw above the ears and washes its face, then patrons will come." Statues of cats washing their faces were found as early as the Northern Wei Dynasty (386 to 534 AD).</p><p></p><p></p><h1>What gender is Maneki-Neko?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>There is <strong>no specific gender</strong> recorded for Maneki-Neko, so it can be either male or female.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The most famous Maneki-Neko cat breed is the Calico Japanese Bobtail. And since most calico cats are female, people assume that Maneki-Neko is female. However, since there are many varieties of Maneki-Neko (which we will talk about later), that isn't necessarily true.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>What does the raised paw of the Maneki-Neko mean?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>You'll often see a Maneki-Neko holding one paw up in the air like a waving position. But it's actually different from waving (which is done side to side). The Japanese style beckoning gesture is made by holding up one hand, palm down, and folding the fingers down and up repeatedly.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Because of the difference in body language and gestures recognized by Westerners and the Japanese, a Lucky Cat with the cat's paw facing upwards, in a beckoning gesture, was made to be more familiar with Westerners.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/11/-v7wFT0KWNZYIJBwk0mGQ_Y8cCsF4VEvJ8LlW_XUzm4gbpkbTp-_VJ9dldKwvHFUvqxdjMR85bUx3sCxJ8w0iqEjM_UhOVLMtyHIfh64h1MhZQ5maXLJR93YlUGYvva0oxkAPC42" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><h2>Different paws raised</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Different Maneki-Neko figures have different paw positions. There's a raised right paw, raised left paw, and sometimes both. Each of these actually has its own meaning.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li><strong>Right paw raised</strong> - This is the most common one. A raised right paw is believed to attract wealth and good luck.</li><li><strong>Left paw raised</strong> - The raised left paw is known to attract customers and invite people to come. This is commonly used in business establishments.</li><li><strong>Both paws raised</strong> - A lucky cat with both paws raised is said to be a combination of both and gives protection from evil.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>No matter what paw is raised on you, Maneki-Neko, it is believed that the higher the paw is raised, the more luck the cat is to invite!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Aside from having one paw raised permanently in the air, there are also new Maneki-Neko figurines with battery-operated or solar-powered arms that move back and forth, making it endlessly engaged in the beckoning gesture.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>What do the different colors of Maneki-Neko mean?</h1><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/11/rpfHysWUu3tecZoGT-7eaxPGqhRtFA3C_NclozW1u4UdJ_fRB_3pPG05AYKYXP6ovcOEIRfauOCIZ8JigvMhkZUTbNDcOU4nLLcii5ubG_yk2oLuJk3m6gipUTCYxyb2auszfG2E" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Over the years, there have been multiple colors of Maneki-Neko seen in the market. These colors actually have different meanings and are targeted towards various aspects of your life.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>1. Tri-color / Calico</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The calico is the traditional and most common type of Maneki-Neko. It is modeled from the Japanese Bobtail cat and is known to bring general good fortune to its owner.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>2. White</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The all-white Maneki-Neko is believed to bring happiness, purity, and positivity for things to come.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>3. Gold</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The golden cat is said to bring vast wealth to the person lucky enough to own it.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>4. Red</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The red Lucky cat is known to ward off illness, especially in children.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>5. Pink</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The pink cat is for those who are in search of romance because it is supposed to beckon love into your life.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>6.

Yellow</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The yellow Lucky Cat is for people who are looking for stability in health and relationships.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>9. Black</h3><p></p><p></p><p>This is probably the most interesting one. In western culture, black cats are known as a symbol of bad luck. However, the black Maneki-Neko is known to keep away stalkers and general evil.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>What is written on Maneki-Neko?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Maneki-Neko figurines are often seen holding an oval-shaped metal plate with an inscription on it. This golden metal plate is actually a golden coin modeled after a Koban, a gold coin used in the Edo Period. One Koban is equivalent to one Ryo, which is roughly $1,000 by today's standards. There are different inscriptions seen on these Ryo coins. Here are some of them:</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/11/zU7yh2SXqmNHepp3kIt8G5ss0Vm0h32oDrEJ8iH_hUAxQOM0_c-ffBrgop7LQMHaZYkYLDxcB9ilYzGZx72NI1wJ86iPlU01sUrIWLMZscLrv5-lRY35RxQGeHeVnO7DleP7ab_x" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><ul><li><strong>Sen Man Ryo</strong> (千万両) - This means 10,000,000 Ryo, which is an incredible amount of money, especially during that period.</li><li><strong>Kai Un</strong> (開運) - This means "open luck."</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Some Maneki-Neko figurines also have banners held by one hand or stuck right on their front.

However, placement is different from that of a business.

Mainly because in Feng Shui, it's considered unlucky to keep broken or chipped items in your home.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/11/NnMbPyG8ze8RbCxawbDkEo7qBuQHWsXM5EXYQvIxO9NEtJN708xnNOYOG4w_tJzEUErB4vac58kAsFpFNwb_Oohn86-IwMFbsBI3ufpVyim1Jvm0dNh3ns712MHAL3zisjdDBd2k" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>But if it's the battery-operated Maneki-Neko where the arms are moving, the most common problem with it is the stopping of the arms.
