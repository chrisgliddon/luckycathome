They are known to attract different energies, depending on their symbols and what they are made of. In particular, one is a ring known to attract good fortune and wealth - the Feng Shui Pixiu Mantra Ring.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In this article, we'll talk about the Feng Shui Pixiu Mantra Ring and how its energy attracting abilities help you improve your wealth.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>What is a Feng Shui Pixiu Mantra Ring?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>A Feng Shui Pixiu Mantra Ring is commonly made of silver or copper with two distinct Feng Shui symbols, the Pixiu and the Mantra.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>What is Pixiu?</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uoIjn-f_GAoeE1UA0-jR1-9ILqKHePi1E7lL4JCYNzYu_46KpPEoDlLG8pT2jVoVyIl_zdzXWo6Z8gpnYx062Na61z8eWGxa6XznAvNfy-3r8AK3TplxD1G7QKWM_CKrj_d2I0qy" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is uoIjn-f_GAoeE1UA0-jR1-9ILqKHePi1E7lL4JCYNzYu_46KpPEoDlLG8pT2jVoVyIl_zdzXWo6Z8gpnYx062Na61z8eWGxa6XznAvNfy-3r8AK3TplxD1G7QKWM_CKrj_d2I0qy"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Pixiu or Pi Xiu is a Chinese celestial auspicious creature that is believed to draw money and wealth. According to Chinese legends, Pixiu can only eat gold, silver, and other precious treasures. When the Jade emperor sealed its anus, all the treasures Pixiu has devoured stayed in its belly for eternity.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This legend led to the belief that Pixiu attracts fortune and won't permit wealth to leave one's life. Thus, making it a truly powerful symbol of wealth.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>What is a Mantra?</h2><p></p><p></p><p>A mantra (originally from Buddhism and Hinduism) is a sacred sound or utterance repeated frequently. It is known to have religious, magical, or spiritual powers.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Pixiu ring is also called a mantra Pixiu ring because a mantra is imprinted on the ring's inner part. This famous Mantra came from ancient Sanskrit and is called Om Mani Padme Hum. This Mantra is believed to possess the power of bringing the wearer good luck, accumulated fortune, and, of course, happiness.</p><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TONUvfdcQJn219sLC4fPIeEAsVCrhzYCssnbqpPX2wLPm4H76FJR5MwykUOOWBSErBvCmq5VhYQpcrajVJmuQuM4FVRyYuHqX-xFJRhchbUjktN34waZLKqsOdElynB5AuRtE2b-" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is TONUvfdcQJn219sLC4fPIeEAsVCrhzYCssnbqpPX2wLPm4H76FJR5MwykUOOWBSErBvCmq5VhYQpcrajVJmuQuM4FVRyYuHqX-xFJRhchbUjktN34waZLKqsOdElynB5AuRtE2b-"></figure></div><p></p><p></p><h3>What does the Om Mani Padme Hum Mantra mean?</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The Mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, translates to praise to the jewel in the lotus. Each syllable has its own meaning too:</p><p></p><p></p><h4>Om - Purifies ego.</h4><p></p><p></p><p>Om is perhaps the most powerful and ancient word used in meditation and chants. It's believed that the frequency/vibration of this syllable connects your soul to the creator. It is used to purify or cleanse. It's also believed to detach the ego, so the soul can temporarily stay and reconnect with divinity.</p><p></p><p></p><h4>Ma - Purifies jealousy.</h4><p></p><p></p><p>Ma represents ethics and is a cleaner of jealous tendencies. It aids you in releasing attachments and provides you with the energies that initiate compassion.</p><p></p><p></p><h4>Ni - Purifies desire.</h4><p></p><p></p><p>Ni represents one's patience and compassion. It purifies the passionate emotions of want and desire.</p><p></p><p></p><h4>Pad - Purifies ignorance.</h4><p></p><p></p><p>Pad represents diligence. It purifies ignorance and lets you release your prejudices, so you no longer stand in judgment of others.</p><p></p><p></p><h4>Me - Purifies greed.</h4><p></p><p></p><p>Me represents concentration. It provides you the ability to disconnect yourself from various earthly attachments, such as greed.</p><p></p><p></p><h4>Hum - Purifies hatred.</h4><p></p><p></p><p>Hum represents the unification of all things. It is the energy that diffuses inner wisdom and purifies hate by letting you release negative thoughts of hatred and aggressive desires.</p><p></p><p></p><p>With all these, the Feng Shui Pixiu Mantra ring may:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Conduct good luck and fortune</li><li>Enhance wealth and riches</li><li>Bring unexpected windfall luck</li><li>Protect individuals and building</li><li>Protect against evil forces, obstacles, and hardship</li><li>Generate good Feng Shui or earth luck</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h1>How do you wear a Pixiu ring?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>In Chinese culture and tradition, rings don't only function as an accessory. You should also wear them on the right finger as each one has significance and meaning.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For a Feng Shui Pixiu Mantra Ring, it is best to wear it on your <strong>right middle finger</strong>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0cMcuPx1hfzsfkyZBdepzvhR91V2c6New82F7ryepZKm5NR_8_fO6A-TrqEkialdYNy3qLSQNaSC0v0Of6GssprZtPkZC_9-x9wyzbI3UAGKFI88UTmHQTaxFrZaPaOLkfv2DJVV" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 0cMcuPx1hfzsfkyZBdepzvhR91V2c6New82F7ryepZKm5NR_8_fO6A-TrqEkialdYNy3qLSQNaSC0v0Of6GssprZtPkZC_9-x9wyzbI3UAGKFI88UTmHQTaxFrZaPaOLkfv2DJVV"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Placing a feng shui ring on your middle finger connects the gap between that finger and the index finger, right where the palm's Wealth Line runs. So it helps to strike a balance and is linked to responsibility. <strong>It is believed that a ring worn on the middle finger attracts money by increasing your money luck and assists you in accumulating wealth.</strong> Thus, making it perfect for a Pixiu Mantra ring. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Be careful <strong>not to wear this ring on your thumb</strong> because it is believed that a ring on the thumb will rob you of all wealth and sabotage your career success.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Where should Pixiu be placed?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>When wearing the Feng Shui Pixiu Mantra ring, Pixiu must be placed on your finger's top center with it facing outwards. If it's in your right hand, Pixiu should face to the right. If it's in your left hand, Pixiu should face to the left.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Wearing Pixiu outwards symbolizes going out to gather wealth, luck and bring it back for you. Do not wear it facing towards yourself.</p><p></p><p></p><p>There are also a few things you need to remember when wearing a Pixiu accessory. Just like the popular <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/index.php/2020/08/12/feng-shui-black-obsidian-bracelet-how-does-it-work/">Pixiu Black Obsidian Bracelet</a>, a Pixiu Mantra ring also requires a few maintenance steps before using and when not in use. Feng Shui experts believe that Pixiu will remain devoted to its master when it's well taken care of. Once neglected, Pixiu can choose to fly away. </p><p></p><p></p><h2>How to activate your Pixiu Mantra ring</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XikziQlgnibW644Tn5F003jnvki1Cghqw-SLD_7Eu7_HCqhOg5zphdndw2rkRI4B_AfnwDRE1IJmj1RRF1NnHHO15LBS_UVe4Zxv_WuNP-ONKX_PD4rZd5IAhWo6-EA58-bRlj4_" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is XikziQlgnibW644Tn5F003jnvki1Cghqw-SLD_7Eu7_HCqhOg5zphdndw2rkRI4B_AfnwDRE1IJmj1RRF1NnHHO15LBS_UVe4Zxv_WuNP-ONKX_PD4rZd5IAhWo6-EA58-bRlj4_"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>To activate your Pixiu Mantra ring, you'll need a silver bowl and a few pieces of gold (coins or other gold items), precious gems, or jewelry. Fill the bowl with these items and place it in your living room (never your bedroom). When not in use, put your Pixiu Mantra ring in the silver bowl with Pixiu facing your front door. It helps Pixiu draw more riches towards your home.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When in use, you must also give it attention by touching Pixiu a few times a day to bring luck and good fortune. Be careful not to touch its eyes and mouth. According to legends, touching Pixiu's mouth may ruin the owner's wealth. There's even an ancient Chinese saying that illustrates how to handle Pixiu:</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong><em>"Touch Pixiu once, good luck comes.</em></strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong><em>Twice money rolls in.</em></strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong><em>Three times, promotions all the way up!"</em></strong></p><p></p><p></p><h1>What finger do you wear a lucky ring on?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>As I mentioned earlier, in Chinese culture, rings must be worn on the correct finger as they have various meanings. The same goes for Feng Shui. Wearing the ring on the right finger has many superstitious beliefs. Here are they:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ogvE2EHpTxMvp9U9Ou6unguiIAcKIpl1rq2HVq6U7mzWgoSLT_uJSX_P91iiJHk7mWQyNM75SLsHZeUVImEUASvKmVVgC1UgoRjRhxWLjkjBB5ZnALHjTsFzTQOr3yQlV-Sqjnmo" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is ogvE2EHpTxMvp9U9Ou6unguiIAcKIpl1rq2HVq6U7mzWgoSLT_uJSX_P91iiJHk7mWQyNM75SLsHZeUVImEUASvKmVVgC1UgoRjRhxWLjkjBB5ZnALHjTsFzTQOr3yQlV-Sqjnmo"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Appropriate hand</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The appropriate hand used for wearing a ring depends on the yin (female) yang (male) symbol. To attract the best Feng Shui energies, men should wear rings on their left hands. Women should wear their rings on their right hands.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>The fingers</h2><p></p><p></p><h3>Index finger</h3><p></p><p></p><p>In Feng Shui, the index finger is known as the finger of authority. Choosing to put a ring on this finger is regarded as a way to demonstrate social standing, power, and authority. It is best for people in sales or business and for someone seeking a promotion or a raise.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Middle finger</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Wearing a ring on the middle finger attracts money by increasing your money luck and accumulating wealth. It is also known to help strike a balance and is associated with responsibility.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Ring finger</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The ring finger is known to attract everlasting love, so it is most connected to marriage and engagement. For Singles, you should avoid wearing a ring on this finger to prevent misunderstanding.  Instead, you can wear a yellow gold ring on your index finger (left male, right female).</p><p></p><p></p><p>When you meet the love of your life, move this ring to your middle finger to guarantee your relationship will move closer to marriage and your ring finger.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d2FrnOWLX1DiVQAuhwC5SM6qVKVQZMDK-MZmiDl7FVkxSZG-32wvIosmY0PeGea5WMlcwG3K9J3NlAd94xYMrDCGRjd7Za98S1dSCDyVs_5kguhmRY7DIH55IdOvDN1I3Km86e52" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is d2FrnOWLX1DiVQAuhwC5SM6qVKVQZMDK-MZmiDl7FVkxSZG-32wvIosmY0PeGea5WMlcwG3K9J3NlAd94xYMrDCGRjd7Za98S1dSCDyVs_5kguhmRY7DIH55IdOvDN1I3Km86e52"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Little/pinky finger</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Wearing a jade ring on your little/pinky finger is believed to bring you wealth. You should wear the lucky ring on your left hand for males, and for females, you should wear it on your right hand. Besides that, it is also said to protect you from villains and backstabbers.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Thumb finger</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Some cultures believe the thumb represents longevity and health and advise to wear a ring on this finger. However, in Feng Shui, it is recommended to never wear a ring on this finger. It is believed that a ring on the thumb will take away all your wealth and sabotage your career success.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Can I wear Pixiu to sleep?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>There are two instances where you should NEVER wear your Feng Shui Pixiu Mantra ring: when bathing and sleeping.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When not in use, place it in your living room, on the silver bowl I mentioned earlier. Remember, Pixiu should be facing your front door or a window to attract wealth luck towards you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Here are other things you should remember when wearing a Pixiu Mantra ring:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Do not allow others to touch it as it could disconnect from you. When someone else touches your ring, cleanse it with water.</li><li>Don't let your Pi Xiu be contaminated by blood. Otherwise, its money-drawing effect could be ruined.</li><li>People aged under 16 and over 70 should not wear a Pixiu Mantra ring as they might not control the vital energy from the fierce creature.</li><li>Pregnant women should not wear any Pixiu accessories. They can do this after giving birth.</li><li>When wearing Pixiu, remember to touch it frequently to let it know you are its master.</li><li>Don't eat chili while wearing Pi Xiu because it can ruin your luck in making money.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h1>Should you wear a Feng Shui Pixiu Mantra Ring?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Now that you know many things about the Feng Shui Pixiu Mantra ring, You can try out its luck and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DATOO-Adjustable-Mantra-Protection-Wealth/dp/B07SSH2K1S">purchase one</a>. But do take note of the responsibilities attached to this ring. You must be ready to do it for you to maximize its wealth-attracting effects. </p><p></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__inner post__footer-inner"><div class="post__updated">Updated: <time datetime="2022-08-29T19:52">August 29, 2022</time></div><div class="post__actions"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button" aria-label="Share"><svg width="32" height="32"><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fchrisgliddon.github.io%2Fluckycathome%2Fhow-to-wear-a-feng-shui-pixiu-mantra-ring%2F" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> Facebook </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchrisgliddon.github.io%2Fluckycathome%2Fhow-to-wear-a-feng-shui-pixiu-mantra-ring%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=How%20to%20Wear%20a%20Feng%20Shui%20Pixiu%20Mantra%20Ring" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> Pinterest </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=How%20to%20Wear%20a%20Feng%20Shui%20Pixiu%20Mantra%20Ring https%3A%2F%2Fchrisgliddon.github.io%2Fluckycathome%2Fhow-to-wear-a-feng-shui-pixiu-mantra-ring%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> WhatsApp</a></div></div></div></div><div class="post__inner author post__author"><div class="author__info"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/authors/melbren/" class="invert author__name" rel="author">Melbren</a></div></div></footer></article></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/maneki-neko-the-famous-lucky-cat/" rel="prev" class="post__nav-link"><span>Previous</span><h5 class="invert">Maneki-Neko: The Famous Lucky Cat</h5></a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/5-natural-ways-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-your-bedroom/" rel="next" class="post__nav-link"><span>Next</span><h5 class="invert">5 Natural Ways to Get Rid of Ants in Your Bedroom</h5></a></div></div></div></nav><div class="section section--light s-t-2 s-b-2 post__related"><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="h6 section__title">You may also like:</h3><div class="feed"><div class="feed post__related-feed"><div class="feed__item"><div class="feed__text"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/kua-number-calculator-how-to-find-your-feng-shui-kua-number/" class="invert">Kua Number Calculator: How to Find Your Feng Shui Kua Number</a></h3><p>In Feng Shui, there is a fundamental concept known as the "Kua Number".
