With so many options on your hands, it can be quite tricky to choose which color is the best.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To help you determine the right paint color for your bedroom, here are some tips and tricks you can follow to make your selection process a lot easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Tips on selecting the best paint color for your bedroom&nbsp;</h1><p></p><p></p><h2>1. Start with colors you love</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The easiest way to determine what colors you're going to use is to choose from the colors you love. Since bedrooms are spaces where you can showcase your personal style, picking a color from your favorites is a no-brainer.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You don't have to bind yourself with traditional colors. You can definitely choose and create your desired mood for the room. Picking colors that reflect your personal vision for the room will help you create a colorful space that feels yours uniquely.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h2>2. Look for a paint color inspiration</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/25/to7LUpRi41hvqeTaa8_CR8jZl9PSUUC2K70EYyWZMQ8nClQkZ04z-k02oGW9lbzBoCK1kxjXrTdZKCGX6Nq7slPePVycwmPIgH1BTIWKE7n8VthasU1DrLVNZrUUrlDYwcIJeOMb" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>There are tons of paint color ideas across different mediums. Catalogs and magazines have always been the staple of decorating inspiration. Retailer sites and paint company websites also offer different inspirations for using colors as well as mixing and matching them to craft a beautiful color harmony in a space.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Social media sites like Instagram and Pinterest also offer tons of paint color inspiration refreshed in real-time. If you want to compile different looks to choose from, Pinterest is great for creating inspiration boards for your favorite ideas. All you need to do is pin it on your profile.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>3. Choose a color scheme based on your furniture</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Consider choosing a color that matches the colors of your bedroom furniture. For example, you have a favorite painting in your bedroom, you can pick a subtle tone from that painting as your walls' inspiration. You can also use colors from other larger pieces like your a chair, floor rug, or beddings, and choose paint colors that match these hues.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But if you're starting from a new bedroom (no furniture), you can disregard this tip.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h2>4. Use lighter or darker shades and its undertones</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/25/evnvTinhOSckuv35_zeXvToG9SY0H4Ont10N21CvnVgEhYe4zE9O-A4rHAQsRytbPu_-NIoxW6tPfa4a4GWXwL798QKHTsoj861CN0v0U99AEd36E1qasd58hWLMdigzu7z2PDIh" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>If you feel like your chosen color doesn't work, don't give up on it right away. Sometimes, you just need a little adjustment to find the perfect paint color. Consider using a lighter or darker shade of the same color. Many paint color samples are put on a paint strip in gradual shades. If you can't find a paint color you'd like, you can also ask the paint store to customize the color depending on the percentages of light or dark shades.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can also work on the undertones of a specific color. A simple peach color may lean to either a pinkish undertone or a more orange undertone. Knowing your chosen color's undertones can help you color coordinate your wall paint from the rest of the components inside your bedroom.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>5. Sample your paint colors</h2><p></p><p></p><p>One important tip before committing to a paint color for your bedroom is to apply a sample color on your wall. Many people tend to return their purchased paint because it was not the one they wanted. Don't make this mistake and apply a sample color on your walls before buying gallons of paint.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It'll also be helpful if you could calculate the amount of paint you'll be needing for your bedroom walls. This will save you from buying too much and wasting paint or buying too little, forcing you to make another trip to the paint center.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h2>6. Paint an accent wall</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/25/OJBilSw_N62k4_uUhlEsPgQJg3XzyGsgS94zk4HTe8ijgV_kz0bswp4fWVCutyQ3_bhEcNgoVhz0Wf5M_WAWGFsQS5n5vMHsS8-pkyE4PU7hKnrUOwBc--_A5JzZ-ayBcivpD8Fs" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Bold and bright colors aren't advisable for bedroom wall paint because it can make a space too enclosed and affect your sleep. But you can still use the bright colors you love while also giving it depth and variety by painting it on one wall instead of all the walls in your bedroom. This is called an accent wall.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can paint it on the wall behind your bed, or the side with a window or a closet. Then, you can pick a coordinating color for the rest of your walls.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>7. Don't forget your ceiling</h2><p></p><p></p><p>It's nice to repaint your walls but don't leave your ceiling behind. Painting your n ceiling can also add depth to your bedroom and create an entirely different mood. If you have low ceilings, choose a light color to make it appear higher. But if you have an elevated ceiling in your bedroom, you can try painting it with a warmer color or a color that's 2 shades darker than your walls.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>8. Pick the right sheen</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Paints have different sheens on gloss. For your walls, you'd want to avoid paints with a really glossy finish as it can accentuate the flaws of your walls.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Here are a few general guidelines for the different paint finish choices:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li><strong>Flat (Matte): </strong>Zero shine and really matte. It's perfect for bedrooms and ceilings.</li><li><strong>Flat Enamel:</strong> This has no shine, but is easier to clean compared to flat paint. It's also perfect for bedrooms, living rooms, and ceilings. If you have kids or pets, this is a better choice compared to flat paint.</li><li><strong>Eggshell Enamel:</strong> This paint has a bit of shine and is suitable for living rooms. It's easier to clean as well where most scuffs can be wiped off using a damp cloth.</li><li><strong>Satin Enamel:</strong> This has more shine compared to the former mentioned. It works well on areas with moisture and is also easily wipeable, making it perfect for bathrooms and kitchens.</li><li><strong>Semi-Gloss Enamel: </strong>This paint is shiny but not super glass-like glossy. It's perfect for trims, cabinets, and high-moisture areas.</li><li><strong>Hi-Gloss Enamel: </strong>This is the super shiny type, almost like a glass finish. It is perfect for high use surfaces like railings or furniture.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h1>Choosing your color family</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Choosing the right color family for your bedroom paint color can be influenced by different factors. Listed below are some color family ideas you can consider.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Neutrals: Calm and Inviting</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/25/mPUJOK5Wc_J6-xe_UASGFAERY_hWcBsDZaahiA8AgL1ozbahFaz76tEf2DDSPsOTTq8Dj5Reqy-4OOUkk3u1Q68oKoZczpkaMZnJ7GGalOtX6H57oGVShemHeaEHUZ-nYVSrW6aL" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>If you want more calm and serene ambiance, go for neutral shades like white, ivory, beige, gray, black, and creme. These shades can also mix with different undertones and are very versatile. If you have a small and boxy bedroom, you can make it appear more spacious by painting it with bright and neutral colors. These colors fade into the background and can make your furniture and other bedroom accents pop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Blue: Peaceful escape</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/25/f9QWWgELu1dqHa18a481Uxokl9_qPicu3jDY1BXFAGF_ldN8ByXlzVkHqefE6Lgi5ZKVS6lqtTH-QYtpZ89pBraZvYCgSY0UzIlozRYq2q-lE1pyhB8OfYWewiSj61lHTXJSr3Jl" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Blue is a peaceful and soothing color, so it's perfect for helping you relax at the end of a long day. Choose shades of light blue and aqua if you want to create a carefree, calming atmosphere. You can also go with some medium to deep blues for a more tranquil feel.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Green: A nature-like atmosphere</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/25/8GIl5TkmQAZ4pyHnN7mSdPDjy1qQn0tmu3sK1zcJMzcQ03PS3YUMX56XGaaeu52aZWmOvDCVmA7zD_gROYhWz7-no9fd1KgNB32hGMyI1oaKuAfzFui7cfmvQcolJrQAGWskAMum" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Nature can give a very refreshing and relaxing vibe, which is why painting your bedroom green will make it feel so peaceful. Light green is excellent for creating an earthy backdrop reminding you of spring and renewal. Medium-toned greens can make your room feel like a cozy escape. And deep, saturated green tones bring in the moody effect of the forest.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Yellow: Happy and cozy</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/25/i05csCNzrqcrZ0B4yJK3XXnyKP4MCzJdNOO04D1GYhDaD8f77hUImV68Dp9O0tmmlpuWMHXTkic6w9_UXt2GCkbFe476FjAwYI5o_FHTo6cBol9BUUo2969bd3QXmFZTAin9yEiB" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Yellow is often associated with happiness. Using yellow paint on your walls can put yourself in a good mood after a long day, and it can also make you feel energized in the morning. Golden hues of yellow create warmth, while pale ones open space and create the illusion of additional light. Avoid using green-based yellows as these may be too dramatic to use as a paint color for your bedroom wall.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Violet: Serenity and romance</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/25/3cPmwwha_hNwzIeLGiV8buMKlS51WuwVb7zDjoUKM7EWkBu4sCtGbWGtMs2GPxmTZvQB-Sbi-INxvY1yMN3Iq6-8yJJDeoZdI_bKhuZ_eOMAX-VGyky6jCsJQ6lYqCzRqVphdvJK" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Choosing the violet paint color for your walls can make your bedroom feel more vintage and romantic. Cooler shades of purple, like periwinkle and lilac, are perfect if you want a peaceful, harmonic vibe. Warmer shades of purple, such as lavender, magenta, and eggplant, are more cheerful and bold.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Red and Orange: Passion and energy</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/25/mc0pnsEoQRRpzTZXJDztEb0nB3uKqsujqa-2EMPd9974Wijw_RPUQmXgNJ_egcmZRX8PrScW3UFmFwpKPPdK5sDR54nmMOobo8KCPQnAP3ya498YQmwvaKZZVP8Cjk4a4XNgksxW" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>While painting your walls in bright and vivid colors is a bold choice, using hues like burgundy red and burnt orange can inspire passion and warmth in your bedroom. However, be careful when choosing these shades. Over-saturated red and orange tones might be too energizing and make it difficult for you to sleep at night.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Pink: Cheerful and youthful</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/25/sZwyZ0KqvYHwaVBN-TfW8PcS-E1lyfSV5bJ-wMi9XpwoY3JZRe2FTUGdHyQOlidaC2_vBviH983g215NsWRnvnBbKMeCZHvfsB87KGoImVowPdl71_n-ysknovDQOyn1VxauaGUV" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Although pink is often associated with kids' rooms, this happy hue can also be used to beautifully brighten up any bedroom. This bright, cheery, and youthful color conjures up happy memories and feels invigorating and optimistic. This is why it's a perfect shade to wake up to each day. You can use pastel shades for a more relaxed and neutral feel or throw in some baby pink to brighten up your bedroom's mood.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Terracotta: Warm and rustic</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/25/0tadj836jH-VDZbnutvM3ylO0ztKfpcYqlsxLYhWyePlsHX6SUD5GsW1ylyBE4h-c0abVeDIzUKMJ9x-k6mYrxDH9PF27r6tspPiQVjmsA0Xxd8SdSkh6a8EcBN8mbpsMiJdDcYV" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>The brownish shade of terracotta has been trending for the past few years and shows no sign of declining popularity. This earthy color gives off a rustic feel and can warm up any space. If you want something more tame than orange, throw in a few brown undertones and go for a terracotta shade instead.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>What color will you choose?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Colors are fun to play with. Don't be afraid to try painting new colors on your bedroom walls and explore what will work best based on your personality and mood. Your bedroom is your personal space, after all. I hope you learned from the tips listed in this article and apply them to your next bedroom paint color revamp.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Time to pick your color inspiration and start painting!</p><p></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__inner post__footer-inner"><div class="post__updated">Updated: <time datetime="2022-08-28T18:53">August 28, 2022</time></div><div class="post__actions"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button" aria-label="Share"><svg width="32" height="32"><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=What%20Color%20to%20Paint%20Your%20Bedroom%3F https%3A%2F%2Fchrisgliddon.github.io%2Fluckycathome%2Fwhat-color-to-paint-your-bedroom%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> WhatsApp</a></div></div></div></div><div class="post__inner author post__author"><div class="author__info"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/authors/melbren/" class="invert author__name" rel="author">Melbren</a></div></div></footer></article></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/5-easy-ways-to-open-a-locked-bedroom-door/" rel="prev" class="post__nav-link"><span>Previous</span><h5 class="invert">5 Easy Ways to Open a Locked Bedroom Door</h5></a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/how-to-wear-a-feng-shui-pixiu-mantra-ring/" rel="next" class="post__nav-link"><span>Next</span><h5 class="invert">How to Wear a Feng Shui Pixiu Mantra Ring</h5></a></div></div></div></nav><div class="section section--light s-t-2 s-b-2 post__related"><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="h6 section__title">You may also like:</h3><div class="feed"><div class="feed post__related-feed"><div class="feed__item"><div class="feed__text"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/kua-number-calculator-how-to-find-your-feng-shui-kua-number/" class="invert">Kua Number Calculator: How to Find Your Feng Shui Kua Number</a></h3><p>In Feng Shui, there is a fundamental concept known as the "Kua Number".
