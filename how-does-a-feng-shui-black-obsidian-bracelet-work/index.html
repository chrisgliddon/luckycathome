Although it's almost like glass in appearance, it's strong enough to make knives. It also comes in various colors, and the black one is used for this particular bracelet.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This stone can also help you:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Go deep within yourself</li><li>Bring pleasure and enjoyment to your life</li><li>Clear out old energy or past lovers from the womb space</li><li>Get in touch with long-buried issues before they explode</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h2>Golden Pixiu</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/4/o7Qm9ocwH7J-aaHRtYi0vh7h1NaMjC0tuNrICv0Fi1uXl192ALQOVXhGknVmyTSbkeudHuK11bhairheNhd7qfaDKmj-OIF1wT-UuE01oLKl6s8tXUSq3Zt-8ch5zlbo7HDhVKeN" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>The bracelet also comes with a golden charm of a creature known as Pi Xiu, Pi Yao, or Pixiu, a powerful Chinese talisman. Pixiu is a well-known mythological creature that resembles a dragon (the one you usually see in a dragon dance during Chinese New Year).</p><p></p><p></p><p>For many years Pixiu statues were used to attract wealth in Feng Shui. It is said that Pixiu has a voracious appetite for jewels that seems to be endless; this makes Pixiu a symbol of good fortune that <strong>attracts, acquires, </strong>and<strong> preserves wealth.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>The Pixiu provides a minimum of six blessings as follows:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Brings good luck and fortune</li><li>Produces good Feng Shui or earth luck</li><li>Enhances wealth and riches</li><li>Protects individuals and building</li><li>Protects the wearer against hardships, evil forces, and obstacles</li><li>Brings an unexpected surge of luck</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h1>What are the benefits of a Feng Shui Black Obsidian Wealth bracelet?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Many people believe in the power of crystals and natural substances to alter the energy they encounter in their everyday lives and the energy they radiate.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Wearing a Black Obsidian Wealth bracelet is known to affect these energies, and these are the said benefits:</p><p></p><p></p><h2>1. Stress Reduction</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/4/w6fTAnu-owiglenrJc7ofsx3v4Qt4dkyziLrkaale1cGyDRyFR7rA60QuQYA5XJbVUQtniE-XOrDg_J2BP4IYaM65LTBEbe3jof9Y18IeRvm48tOSw6MRtp8Z1PsGsQF6B2imnke" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>The Feng Shui Black Obsidian bracelet helps in reducing stress by balancing your energy.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>With balanced thoughts and energy, you'll be able to respond more to situations, be less likely to be drawn into arguments, and better control your emotions and thoughts. You'll also be less prone to diseases and will allegedly heal faster when feeling ill.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>2. Cleanse and Protection from Negative Energies</h2><p></p><p></p><p>When worn correctly, the Black Obsidian Bracelet is said to radiate powerful metaphysical properties that will help protect you from negative energies.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It protects you from shadow traits like anxiety, fear, addiction, and anger. It acts as a mirror to your inner self. The bracelet also resonates with the root chakra as it aids with grounding and connecting to the Earth.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>3. Provides Psychic Protection</h2><p></p><p></p><p>People may find themselves surrounded by psychic clouds or smog around or within their aura, especially if they've been living a stressful life. The Feng Shui Black Obsidian bracelet claims to powerfully and effectively provide protection and cleansing of your aura.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h2>4. EMF Protection</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/4/B96YMguSVeBPldynfuBOzx3WTuPg3yNYI03-Vw36jfG7nHsBfgP9dQAeSmeRQzmliWSuGeF-0cE7iECmr3oNv-zhm3yvGEC3uctmtjQ0z2q4PmrT27nLOJ-QkyCywmQmm8_RK0aC" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Those who sit a lot in front of their computers or are often exposed to gadgets, you could have high exposure to Electro-Magnetic Forces of EMF. Electro-Magnetic Forces are emitted by electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, PCs, TVs, etc.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Black Obsidian Wealth bracelet, particularly its Obsidian crystals, could help protect you from EMF radiation because it emits powerful orgone energy.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h1>How to use a Feng Shui Black Obsidian Wealth bracelet?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>To use the Feng Shui Obsidian Wealth bracelet, you need to activate, cleanse, and wear them, of course. But unlike ordinary bracelets, there are suggested methods on how to do the three mentioned.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>How do I activate my Feng Shui Black Obsidian Pixiu bracelet?</h2><p></p><p></p><p>To activate your Obsidian Wealth Bracelet, washed it in clean water to cleanse it. You also need to gently touch the Pixiu dragon to transfer your energy and let it know that you're the bracelet owner. Avoid letting someone touch your Pixiu dragon, but if it happens, just cleanse the bracelet with sage or camphor.</p><p></p><p></p><p>After washing it, place the bracelet on a clean saucer and let it sit under the sun for as long as possible to further cleanse and activate it. Remember, it must be under direct sunlight.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When the moon shines, let it sit under the moonlight by a window and leave it overnight.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can now wear your cleansed and activated Obsidian Wealth bracelet.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can cleanse your crystals and recharge them with Sunlight energy with a minimum of 30 mins. Do this at least once a month.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>How do you wear a Feng Shui Black Obsidian bracelet?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>This part can be a bit confusing. Some say that you should wear your Obsidian bracelet on your left hand because the <strong>left side attracts good wealth luck</strong>. Wearing it on your right hand may result in losing your fortune since putting it on the <strong>right side means you're giving your money away</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Some also say that you should wear it on your dominant hand, or the hand you use for writing. Since many people are right-handed, this can be a dilemma (good for you if you are left-handed).</p><p></p><p></p><p>However, it is said that it's your energy that activates the results you require and receive from the bracelet. So it's best if you maintain joyful and gratifying energy and give your best in everything you do to achieve good results.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/4/DLBDgx7DmX3tfWhzV0mc51aLgo-jybtUMkykO_N5a5VGul6JVltnUEXap3iYkSJX18WF62FTfGHGGx_JzoYuHmSUNuor4tAse2s_p0DcyFxjJcmTl7RJic0zhoRXrtcFaDdsVK2V" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>If your bracelet has one Pixiu dragon, it should be facing outwards as it symbolizes going out to gather wealth and bring them to you. Do not wear it facing towards yourself.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If your bracelet has two Pixiu dragons, it's most likely that they are facing each other. So their positions don't matter since it's the same either way.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>When should you NOT wear the Feng Shui Black Obsidian bracelet?</h2><p></p><p></p><p>DO NOT wear your bracelet when:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>you shower</li><li>washing dishes</li><li>going to sleep</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>When you're not wearing your bracelet, always put them in your living room with the Pixiu dragon facing your front door to guard and protect our home.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Don't put it inside your <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/index.php/2020/08/12/how-to-feng-shui-your-bedroom/">bedroom</a> because its energy may affect your sleep, leading to sleepless nights. You might also have bad dreams, due to the energy around Pixiu. </p><p></p><p></p><p>If you're living in a studio apartment where there is no separation of bedrooms from other areas of your home, try to make a small living space. You can do this by putting a chair and a table in one area. You can place your bracelet on this living space when you sleep or do something that involves water, with Pixiu facing the front door.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Who should NOT wear the Feng Shui Black Obsidian bracelet?</h2><p></p><p></p><p>These following individuals should NOT wear the Black Obsidian bracelet:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Individuals ages 70 and above</li><li>Individuals ages 16 and below</li><li>Individuals that are pregnant</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>The people ages 70 above and 16 below are said to have weaker spirits. Wearing a Pixiu, which releases powerful energy, could affect them. The same goes for pregnant women.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h1>How much is a Feng Shui Black Obsidian Bracelet?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>When you look at <a href="https://uniquefengshui.com/wealth-bracelets/">Feng Shui products</a> sites, they sell some Feng Shui Black Obsidian Bracelet that usually costs around <strong>$19 - $32 per piece</strong>. Some put it up on sale from time to time, so if you're planning to buy one, you should watch out for that.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Be mindful, because some sellers allegedly sell 'fake' Black Obsidian bracelets. Authentic ones apparently use gold and real obsidian crystals for their pieces, which is why they can get a bit pricey. In contrast, fake ones use cheap beads that cost very cheap on eBay.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Feng Shui experts say that using fake products don't work the same as real ones. Much like other things. If you want an authentic one, you must be willing to pay a bit more.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Should you wear a Feng Shui Black Obsidian Pixiu Bracelet?</h1><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/4/odhkBt9zjGXOqXCfmcyyUZiG0zQW6qaDVS0_q5S05Pm33T3Xq1Ygx39VH8TMZQM2MfcTnhUXb5rHgGTkNVt1cxxgk94OJCX9HZgAKV_OOjWPFkcmSqltRU_rSWOMp8hLwrIRLwkO" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>If you're a firm believer of <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/index.php/2020/08/12/feng-shui-basics-attracting-positive-energy-into-your-home/">Feng Shui</a> and the energy it says to attract, you might want to try out this bracelet. But be prepared for the conditions attached to wearing it. Make sure you follow the practices that are all mentioned above to ensure the full effect of the product.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Some people testify about the powers of this Black Obsidian bracelet, saying how it helps increase their wealth and attract more luck. Sure, that could happen.</p><p></p><p></p><p>However, don't expect it to work for everyone. You shouldn't expect yourself to get the same results. After all, this is still based on the Chinese pseudoscientific traditions known as Feng Shui. There is no scientific evidence that these are real and if it does work.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You know what they say, try at your own risk.</p><p></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__inner post__footer-inner"><div class="post__updated">Updated: <time datetime="2022-08-28T18:53">August 28, 2022</time></div><div class="post__actions"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button" aria-label="Share"><svg width="32" height="32"><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=How%20Does%20a%20Feng%20Shui%20Black%20Obsidian%20Bracelet%20Work%3F https%3A%2F%2Fchrisgliddon.github.io%2Fluckycathome%2Fhow-does-a-feng-shui-black-obsidian-bracelet-work%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> WhatsApp</a></div></div></div></div><div class="post__inner author post__author"><div class="author__info"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/authors/melbren/" class="invert author__name" rel="author">Melbren</a></div></div></footer></article></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/99-crafts-to-make-and-sell-for-money/" rel="prev" class="post__nav-link"><span>Previous</span><h5 class="invert">99 Crafts to Make and Sell for Money</h5></a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/what-is-my-feng-shui-element/" rel="next" class="post__nav-link"><span>Next</span><h5 class="invert">What is My Feng Shui Element?</h5></a></div></div></div></nav><div class="section section--light s-t-2 s-b-2 post__related"><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="h6 section__title">You may also like:</h3><div class="feed"><div class="feed post__related-feed"><div class="feed__item"><div class="feed__text"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/kua-number-calculator-how-to-find-your-feng-shui-kua-number/" class="invert">Kua Number Calculator: How to Find Your Feng Shui Kua Number</a></h3><p>In Feng Shui, there is a fundamental concept known as the "Kua Number".
