And in Feng Shui, the primary entryway holds a great deal of importance because it's where the <em>Chi</em> or the positive energy comes in.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In this article, we'll give you our top 8 tips on how you can Feng Shui your entryway.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Tip #1: Activate your front door regularly</h1><p></p><p></p><p>In <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/feng-shui-basics-attracting-positive-energy-into-your-home/">Feng Shui</a>, they consider the front as the portal of energy or the mouth of chi. Although there might be a backdoor or other doors that you use to go inside or outside, a home's official front door is still the mouth of chi.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It's okay if you use the backdoor or some other doors daily, but never forget to activate your front door regularly. You can do this by passing through it daily or at least once every nine days. Opening and using the door is the most crucial part because if you're not using your front door, you block out energy and opportunities.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Tip # 2: Always consider the three elements that make up your entryway</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Entryways or your home's entrance have three essential elements: Door size, decor, and view. These three can affect the positive chi that enters your home.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Door size</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Your front door should be the largest door in your home. The bigger your door, the more chi can enter. But never forget to put the size of your home into consideration. It should still be in proportion to your house.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1_TU-L43FnYjpcFYzjAHOziz0jwNskTxv6bDQXXSmm4HBATSAIdFXxo0F_xtsf94-HIjWhIgxZux5_gqhr5P0q6p9O3g1Dbcex1uaBElZ4FDFAiaU-ytAkmDhXj7bu2gGM3gDXf7" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 1_TU-L43FnYjpcFYzjAHOziz0jwNskTxv6bDQXXSmm4HBATSAIdFXxo0F_xtsf94-HIjWhIgxZux5_gqhr5P0q6p9O3g1Dbcex1uaBElZ4FDFAiaU-ytAkmDhXj7bu2gGM3gDXf7"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Decor</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The welcoming decors of your entryway, such as the furniture, lightings, and others, should also be chosen carefully. We'll talk more about this later.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>View</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The view seen from your front door is also important. Ensure that the front door is not facing directly to the toilet, kitchen, or straight out to the back of your house. These are known as inauspicious views with your front door. If it somehow can't be avoided, you can place a curtain, standing screen, or plant to help slow down the sightline to an inauspicious view.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Tip #3: Choose the right decor and furniture</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Each house has different entryways. Depending on how big or small your home is, your setup may be a lot different from others. But whether or not you have a spacious entryway, some decor and furniture would be suitable to attract positive chi energy. Here's what you should consider when picking them out.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Lights</h2><p></p><p></p><p>It's essential to have proper lighting in your entryway. Good lighting can add beneficial energy to your home's entrance and lift its chi. You can elevate the lighting on your foyer by adding some lamps, a crystal chandelier, or some scones if possible. But if you want some minimalist and straightforward light fixture, just bright overhead lighting will do. What's important is to keep the space well illuminated and welcoming for anyone who's coming inside.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Artwork</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Add personality to your entryway by displaying lovely artwork. Choose ones that give a positive vibe to make the entrance calmer and inviting to people coming inside. You can also put a shelf or a small table underneath to give it a more homey vibe (given that you have a space for it). Avoid displaying personal objects like family pictures on your entryway. It's because this area is more public and easily seen from the outside, just a simple reminder to protect your privacy.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Elements</h2><p></p><p></p><p>You can also activate elements if you want to enhance a specific area in your life. Each sector represents a particular life area like wealth (southeast), fame/recognition (south), career (north), and so on. You can activate these energies by knowing the sector of your house's entrance and putting in the assigned element.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For example, if your entrance is facing north, it corresponds to your career. The north direction's governing element is water, so you can put a small fountain, an aquarium, or artworks that feature water to activate your career energy.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Plants</h2><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Incorporating plants into an area makes it a lot more vibrant and lively in an instant. You can also use plants as a barrier or protection from negative energies coming from outside or inauspicious views that can't be avoided. However, you must ensure that you choose the right kind of indoor plants and practice due diligence to maintain and nourish them.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Have a shoe rack</h2><p></p><p></p><p>If you're the type who leaves shoes on your front door, it's best if you have a shoe rack or a cabinet where you can keep them. Never leave your shoes scattered near your front door as it is considered inauspicious.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Rugs</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Putting a welcoming rug or doormat on your front door is an excellent addition to your front door. It can give off an inviting feel instantly to the environment. Make sure your rug is low enough and allows the main door to open and close freely. You should also replace your rug or doormat with a new one at least once a year. Replacing the doormat will remove the accumulated negative Chi over the year.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can choose the color and material of the rug based on your door’s facing direction. Here are some ideas you can use:</p><p></p><p></p><p>Rug/doormat ideas based on your facing direction</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Direction</strong></td><td><strong>Element</strong></td><td><strong>Color</strong></td><td><strong>Shape</strong></td></tr><tr><td>North</td><td>Water</td><td>Blue, Black</td><td>Round or wavy</td></tr><tr><td>South</td><td>Fire</td><td>Red, Purple, Orange</td><td>Angular shapes - triangles/stars</td></tr><tr><td>West / Northwest</td><td>Metal</td><td>White, Gray</td><td>Square or round</td></tr><tr><td>East / Southeast</td><td>Wood</td><td>Green, Brown</td><td>Rectangle</td></tr><tr><td>Southwest / Northeast</td><td>Earth</td><td>Yellow</td><td>Square</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p></p><p></p><h1>Tip #4: Choose the right sector color</h1><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DagHEZCrebB63SKOTiyiIkJIR9tSxPjxXGl8KOVPb4PzSwnM9zNZwDIpChjH7te37i7-zsZEvrkUEzy7yyviKOutO0PmcC1k-E3tKJtiYpXHk_sq02CiSzH5KYHLD0XhdL3rIBwD" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is DagHEZCrebB63SKOTiyiIkJIR9tSxPjxXGl8KOVPb4PzSwnM9zNZwDIpChjH7te37i7-zsZEvrkUEzy7yyviKOutO0PmcC1k-E3tKJtiYpXHk_sq02CiSzH5KYHLD0XhdL3rIBwD"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Choosing the right colors is essential in Feng Shui. Having the right color in this sector can help enhance or elevate the positive energy that enters our home. Similarly, choosing the wrong colors can result in inauspicious energy, which is a big no-no.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can determine the right color for your entryway and front door by knowing your house's facing direction. You can do this by <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/how-to-use-a-feng-shui-compass/">using a Feng Shui compass</a> or an ordinary compass. Knowing your facing direction will help you determine the element that corresponds to your path. Thus, helping you select the color based on that element. Here are some of the perfect colors to use per direction.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li><strong>East </strong>- Green, Brown, Black, Blue, Purple</li><li><strong>Northeast </strong>- light Yellow, Beige, Clay, Red, Pink, Orange, Magenta, Coral</li><li><strong>North </strong>- Black, Blue, White, Gray, Metallic</li><li><strong>Northwest </strong>- Gray, White, Metallic, Clay, Beige, Light Yellow</li><li><strong>West </strong>- White, Gray, Metallic, Light Yellow, Beige, Clay</li><li><strong>Southwest</strong> - Beige, Clay, Light Yellow, Red, Pink, Orage, Magenta, Coral</li><li><strong>South</strong> - Yellow, Orange Pink, Coral, Magenta, Purple, Green, Brown</li><li><strong>Southeast</strong> - Green, Brown, Black, Blue, Light Yellow</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h1>Tip #5: Avoid Feng Shui mistakes that could drain your money from your home</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Activating your entryway to attract better chi inside your home could result in many positive things. But when you do it wrong, you might also break the right flow of chi, causing an unwanted imbalance in your home. Some mistakes could even result in financial problems, making money drain faster from your home.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Here are some common Feng Shui mistakes to avoid if you don't want to encounter this problem.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>BAD: The fireplace is visible from the front door</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Having your fireplace visible from the front door or directly in-line with the front door is inauspicious in Feng Shui. It means you're burning through money from the fireplace.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>BAD: The toilet is visible from the front door</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/A3m0SwNU7zX2VsHg22vJ4QRtWs0KHi5s8NfpCYm2X0C1FBHHNSktZli7DoWjy8gzZU22z82Wr7kjsEzljCr3neRzOejV5185dNYZsld0GvOnkZNUmx7f8kXcdlkmJD3rc1kFuQoU" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is A3m0SwNU7zX2VsHg22vJ4QRtWs0KHi5s8NfpCYm2X0C1FBHHNSktZli7DoWjy8gzZU22z82Wr7kjsEzljCr3neRzOejV5185dNYZsld0GvOnkZNUmx7f8kXcdlkmJD3rc1kFuQoU"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Having a visible view of the toilet from your front door is also considered inauspicious and can cause money loss in Feng Shui. The money will fail to accrue if this happens. You can fix this by putting a standing screen, a plant, or any object that could block the view of the toilet view so that the chi won't flow right through.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The same thing could happen if you have a second floor and the toilet is directly above your entryway. In case you have this at home, you can keep the entryway light on to help lift the wealth and income chi at your front door.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>BAD: The backdoor is directly in-line with the front door</h2><p></p><p></p><p>In Feng Shui, one of the most common ways to lose wealth and money is when your house has a poison arrow. A poison arrow is used in Feng Shui to describe when your front door is in-line with the back door or a window. Poison arrows may cause your money to drain quickly, so it's best to avoid this mistake.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But if you encounter this mishap at home, you can also fix it by blocking the back door or window view using a standing screen, curtain, plant, etc.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Tip #6: Use mirrors strategically</h1><p></p><p></p><p>People often use mirrors to make spaces look bigger by reflecting surfaces and light. Mirrors are good decor in Feng Shui as it reflects and doubles the energy in an area. But remember that mirrors don't reflect selectively, it reflects everything - both positive and negative. You can place mirrors on your entryway but make sure that it's not reflecting your front door. It will result in the energy bouncing back out when it enters, pushing the chi energy and wealth away.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Place it somewhere that doesn't reflect your front door, sharp edges, or any other door. You should also check other mirrors in your house and make sure they don't reflect your main entrance at any angle.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Tip #7: Check your stairs</h1><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XDOYRjMJJCsgFryIhHLttys-DHkoxu-dsQg95EZyA00A9F-j6IB9wyfNIsUe6kkvJTLRTsVptMG0Tf5tmObJmn7kqpxqFgcxWeMLFsR75GO5F0ZtSJ7-ywuBcQWeZlweDU2ZBdng" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is XDOYRjMJJCsgFryIhHLttys-DHkoxu-dsQg95EZyA00A9F-j6IB9wyfNIsUe6kkvJTLRTsVptMG0Tf5tmObJmn7kqpxqFgcxWeMLFsR75GO5F0ZtSJ7-ywuBcQWeZlweDU2ZBdng"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Having your <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/property/2018/07/392311/feng-shui-stairway-rules-balance-energy" class="rank-math-link">staircase facing the front door directly</a> isn't a good sign in Feng Shui. If your staircase is right in front of the main entrance, it could result in the energy rushing quickly upstairs or downstairs and not going onto the main floor. It will leave the main floor empty of the positive chi energy it's supposed to have.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In case you have this problem, you can still fix it by placing proper decor and furniture onto your entryway. Use decors that could slow down the energy and guide it to the areas that need positive energy. You can use artwork, plants, mirrors, and other items appropriate for your wealth corner.  </p><p></p><p></p><h1>Tip #8: You can apply Feng Shui on tiny entryways too</h1><p></p><p></p><p>If you're living in a small apartment or studio type room where there's not much space from the front door, no worries, you can still apply Feng Shui on your entryway. You can do any of the Feng Shui tips mentioned above, even just one or two.</p><p></p><p></p><p>And the most important thing is to keep your entryway clean. Remove shoes, clothes, and other unnecessary objects near your front door. Keep it clean and free of clutter so the chi energy can enter freely.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Bonus tips!</h1><p></p><p></p><h2>Tip #9: Give your front door some love</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Aside from your entryway, the front door itself plays a significant part in good home Feng Shui. It's a big part of the entire entrance, so it has a substantial impact on the flow of energy that enters your home. With that said, it's worth giving your front door a bit of attention and take a look at it from time to time. Here's what you should do:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Check the doorknob and the locks. Make sure they are working fine.</li><li>Check for chips and cracks. Try and fix them if possible.</li><li>Choose a solid and sturdy wooden door. Try to avoid having windows on your door. Having a solid wooden door will give you a better sense of security too.</li><li>The front door or main door should be the biggest door in your home (some even use double doors). However, make sure that it's the right size and is proportional to your home.  </li></ul><p></p><p></p><h2>Tip #10: Keep everything clean!</h2><p></p><p></p><p>This tip is mostly a given. Just like any other area in your house, always keep your entryway clean and clutter-free! Although some people like putting things near the front door for easy access, make sure you'll organize these things properly and not just leave them scattered around the area. Here are some things you can do.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li> Don't leave shoes near or right at your front door. It's considered inauspicious in Feng Shui and viewed as clutter. If you want to have your shoes near your entryway, make sure they are kept inside a shoe cabinet, shoe rack, or any other closed cabinet. This trick will keep your entrance tidy and free of unsightly messy footwear.</li><li>Don't put too much stuff on your entryway. You don't have to put furniture or cabinets if it's not necessary. Keep your foyer or entryway clean and spacious as much as possible. Remove obstructions and clear the pathway so the auspicious chi energy can come in freely and spread further and deeper into your home.</li><li>For those who have bigger entryways, put a console table in it. You can place your purse, keys, and other items you'd want for an easy grab on your way out. Again, it's essential to keep things well-organized.  </li></ul><p></p><p></p><h1>Time to Feng Shui <em>your</em> Entryway!</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Paying attention to details is what will make your Feng Shui entryway even better. By following these tips, you'll have pretty much everything covered. Just make sure not to overdo all of these and prioritize what will make your home feel comfortable.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Enhancing the Feng Shui in your entryway will attract and encourage the positive chi energy to enter your home. Combine this with other Feng Shui principles, and the auspicious energy will eventually spread throughout the different rooms and enhance all sectors in your humble abode.</p><p></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__inner post__footer-inner"><div class="post__updated">Updated: <time datetime="2022-08-29T20:02">August 29, 2022</time></div><div class="post__actions"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button" aria-label="Share"><svg width="32" height="32"><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=How%20to%20Feng%20Shui%20Your%20Entryway%3A%20Top%208%20Tips%20You%20Should%20Know https%3A%2F%2Fchrisgliddon.github.io%2Fluckycathome%2Fhow-to-feng-shui-your-entryway-top-8-tips-you-should-know%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> WhatsApp</a></div></div></div></div><div class="post__inner author post__author"><div class="author__info"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/authors/melbren/" class="invert author__name" rel="author">Melbren</a></div></div></footer></article></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/15-easy-ways-to-make-a-small-bedroom-look-bigger/" rel="prev" class="post__nav-link"><span>Previous</span><h5 class="invert">15 Easy Ways To Make A Small Bedroom Look Bigger</h5></a></div></div></div></nav><div class="section section--light s-t-2 s-b-2 post__related"><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="h6 section__title">You may also like:</h3><div class="feed"><div class="feed post__related-feed"><div class="feed__item"><div class="feed__text"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/kua-number-calculator-how-to-find-your-feng-shui-kua-number/" class="invert">Kua Number Calculator: How to Find Your Feng Shui Kua Number</a></h3><p>In Feng Shui, there is a fundamental concept known as the "Kua Number".
