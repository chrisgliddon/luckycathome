If you're like me, you'd agree that having a good night's sleep is one of the most rewarding things ever.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Suppose you still find it hard to get the best out of your bedroom even after buying expensive mattresses, new air conditioning, etc. In that case, you might need to optimize it by using Feng Shui.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It doesn't matter if you're just moving in or are already sleeping in this bedroom for years, these steps aren't as complicated as you think it would be. In this article, we'll show you tips on how you can improve your room (and your sleep) through <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/index.php/2020/08/12/feng-shui-basics-attracting-positive-energy-into-your-home/">Feng Shui</a>.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Why should I use Feng Shui in my bedroom?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Feng Shui is an ancient Chinese philosophy that aids energy forces (chi) to bring harmony between individuals and the environment. It arranges the spatial orientation of your furniture and décor in relation to the flow of energy (Chi).</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the Feng Shui philosophy, the bedroom is the most personal to you and where you spend most of your time. Moreover, you spend most of your passive state in this room while you're asleep, so you're affected by all the energies inside the room.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h1>How do I arrange my bedroom for good energy?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>The proper arrangement and the right things to place inside your room have a significant effect on your bedroom's energy. Since Feng Shui is about creating the right balance between these factors, the layout is definitely important.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Which way should you place your bed?</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The bed is the most significant furniture piece inside your bedroom, and you need to put it on the right spot. Listed below are some important things to keep in mind when placing your bed.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Place it in a "commanding position."&nbsp;</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>This means, the bed should be facing the door but is not directly in line with the door.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Placing your bed in a direct line with the door allows the energy to flow quickly, thus, giving the unsettling feeling that could disrupt your sleep.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Place your headboard against a solid wall.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Putting the headboard part against a solid wall provides a feeling of support and protection. Make sure that only the headboard part is against a wall. There should be spaces on the left and right sides as well as the foot area.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Also, avoid placing it against a wall with a toilet on the other side.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/7/N_ANDhSkxaluyyAVYrZqB0cYwLZl1aQSBceJ9MRIFvEYwGR6uc1X1r7p5AWQZVso5CDykYXvGNnufgqMiM6FQ4s2YNervEyG-szr_D_tV_os0x889yhwIVvl3GjBJfhLWRwoeQ9r" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Headboards and bed frames</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Since we're talking about headboard placement, you should definitely get a bed frame with a headboard. In Feng Shui, headboards represent support and stability in your life, especially your romantic relationships.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you're using a box spring frame, you can get a headboard separately. Or better yet, get a new bed frame. Go for solid wood headboard and bed frames. In western Feng Shui, wood relates to the symbolic nature of supporting your body and energy when sleeping.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Avoid positioning your bed under heavy objects and sharp angles.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>You should also be conscious of your bedroom's ceiling if you want to ensure a good night's sleep. Avoid positioning your bed and sleeping under beams, ceiling fans, a skylight, or an angled or slanted ceiling design.</p><p></p><p></p><p>These things relate to the Sha energy(which drains a person's energy), and could negatively affect your sleep.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>How to decorate your bedroom with Feng Shui?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>After positioning your bed, you can move to the decor and other fixtures. Here are some Feng Shui related tips on how you can decorate your bedroom.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>The Do’s</h1><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Decorate in pairs</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>In feng shui, pairs are known to promote harmonious, loving energy as well as balance. The most common practice is to place nightstands on both sides of your bed. If you want to put lamps, you should also put one on both sides. You should also set two pillows, two chairs (if you have them), and anything you can have in pairs.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/7/T3Hr8yphBfw9WG2KeXIUcUDbC5C82nxPSu_91GD5VQ8UFAhF9eySum0RwFTMyQ3IIyeA2picAqz-bp4F87PBAogbwIE_59owE_RRI9Rxn3EpqTveY86OBVEIEdlpCzK3Ef0km3T7" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>They don't really need to be matching. You can choose any design or shape, as long as there is one on both sides.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Having two of these things will also allow your partner, or future partner, to have their own share of the item. Again, this creates balance and harmony.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Use Feng Shui-friendly colors.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>In Feng Shui, specific colors are known to attract maximum sensuality and peaceful vibes in the bedroom and promote restful sleep. The best colors for your bedroom largely depends on what you need. But the rule of thumb is to opt for muted shades you'd find in nature or skin tones. Here are a few:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Browns</li><li>Creams</li><li>Off-white</li><li>Blues</li><li>Greens</li><li>Peaches</li><li>Pinks</li><li>Reds</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>If you're after support and relaxation, go for the muted and earthy tones like browns, creams, and whites. If you're looking for healing and vitality, go for blues and greens. If you want to attract romance, go for peaches, pinks, and reds.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Be careful with the "romance" colors, and don't overdo them. Instead of painting the walls with pink or peach, try using them as accent colors instead. You can choose pillows, rugs, or other small objects with these colors.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Put the books away</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Books and other work-related materials should be kept outside the bedroom according to Feng Shui principles. Doing this will allow you to rest and turn off your mind more effectively.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Having that book your reading on your nightstand is okay. But if you have stacks and stacks of books in your bedroom, you may have to put them somewhere else.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Declutter in your bedroom</li></ul><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/7/iIYvypK0QYerP4uxjxFH0QkWVuUpNTHwGAWktllNvY8zpTJ_RRxLif28QtvcbwJ-iFvDCwPZ5Os0PGeywVPraqOhM7d_FA5IAIg6AKGiKs7BFr_pCQc0qJ2mEiYdVMxl8B-ME-er" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Clutter blocks the flow of positive energy, the vitality, and positive feelings that come along with it. It can also cause stress, so it's essential to let go of the unnecessary stuff in your bedroom.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Declutter, especially under your bed. Some people like storing bins and other things under their beds since it's hidden. But this is a big no-no in Feng Shui. Discard those piles of papers or those gifts from your ex that you've been keeping. You're just like "sleeping on problems," which is not good.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Clearing the clutter, including your stuff in your closet, creates a positive impact on your sleep quality and your mindset and mood.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Decorate with accessories that nourish the senses</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>You'll want to use a Bagua map to determine what elements to put into your room. For example, if your bedroom is positioned in the health and family area, the dominant element is wood. You can try to incorporate greens and blues to represent that element. After consulting a map, consider what other details you can add that evoke the senses.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Here are some suggestions:</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Sight:</strong> Go for the colors that coordinate with <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/index.php/2020/08/12/what-is-my-feng-shui-element/">your element</a>. If your element is wood, go for more earthy tones. Brown side tables or pillows are excellent.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Smell:</strong> For smell, you can use a diffuser and essential oil of your choice. The lavender and jasmine scents are calming scents, which are good for relaxation.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Sound: </strong>If you have trouble sleeping, the soothing tones of a white noise machine can promote deep sleep. You can also try putting on some relaxing background music or some rain sound effects if possible.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Touch:</strong> Go with soft, inviting fabrics that are great for bedrooms. I'd recommend satin, velvet, and Egyptian cotton for your sheets, cushions, pillows, and curtains. Choose bed sheets that feel particularly soft to the skin.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Taste:</strong> Some people do have a mini-fridge in their rooms. But if you're not that type, you can throw in a jar of cough mints or lozenges. Mints come in different colors, so you can probably choose one that goes with your room color scheme.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>The Don'ts</h2><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Don't hang a mirror</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>In Feng Shui, mirrors promote the Yang energy (movement), which is the exact opposite of the energy you want to cultivate inside your room - the Yin (restfulness) energy.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/7/TWpDnBk1C4lOU9stseIHsAPFoBelR_kslaaX7VKeG29iJMs3N53Pad5fR0TsstF-Q8clImLItHVLYnfYScCBRDyxNoaW9DMyrcvS2M8-KefV8gvQQM6ackCknSLaXdydugs1R4FC" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>But many people do want mirrors in their bedrooms, so there is an exception. You can put up a mirror, but make sure that it's not facing directly to your bed. Have it face a window. Doing this could also bring in more daylight into the room.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Don't use any water decor.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Don't bring an actual water feature into your room. Things like aquariums or even water-centric artwork and photos should be avoided. Water is known to have potent chi energy that is used to attract wealth and financial success. Well, you don't really need that in your bedroom. It can disrupt your sleep and the serene vibe too.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What's more, water extinguishes fire - the element that attracts passion. That is what should be in your bedroom.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Avoid large, looming furniture.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Like what we mentioned earlier, your bed should be the main furniture in your bedroom. Not a massive couch or a large cabinet. Huge furniture could make you feel oppressed in your bedroom. This could also disrupt the right flow of chi energy traveling inside your room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Don't bring in too much EMFs</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Nowadays, we can't live without our gadgets. But sometimes we really need to unplug from technology and enjoy things off-screen. The best place to do that is your bedroom.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/7/8m_ZsOurtrcbK5TLgi6hTJ8_Od49n6CcUPVL0Dalz0DLSKijoqeroCDj60cmkZp179e7OK7Yq-AIKacnGPHuQ1Pkf3ft2fssr5-__UW_1j0-1E3rglTqXIzsaIccgquNoTdj2MyP" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>EMFs are electric and magnetic fields made by electronic devices and power lines. These are harmful and could affect our well-being, including our quality of sleep.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you can't seem to have a good night's rest, try your best to keep electronics out of the bedroom.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h1>How to feng shui your bedroom in college?</h1><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/7/BvhBs5CVMud-zG0rziOJete_XTiOOyoJ8N59-pR3cTrYjzg60ed_34JTc1VP0YiwR4LZE6jiAo72ZR0Sle9C5HRHLsOHGToQk1DuEqLahAdR8agI9Oxu8fpngg1-F8Vaemd7T_QF" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Compared to your bedroom at home, college or dorm rooms can be a bit smaller, and you can't change as much. You can still apply the tips we mentioned above as they can still work even in small spaces.</p><p></p><p></p><p>However, as a college student, here are additional Feng Shui tips you can follow to improve the energy flow in your dorm room.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>1. Separate your study area from your sleeping area.</h2><p></p><p></p><p>College students tend to do their homework, hang out, and eat on their beds. You should avoid this. Try your best to create a separate space where you can study, eat, and hang out with your friends or roommate. This will let you have a calm place despite the rest of your hectic life.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>2. Desk Against the Wall</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Your desk should also follow the command position. Therefore, having a desk that's facing a wall is contrary to the Feng Shui practice.&nbsp; The feng shui desk placement looks out over the room with the door in plain view. It also mandates that a wall be directly behind you when sitting at the desk. The wall provides the support you need to accomplish your studies.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>3. Display memorable items&nbsp;</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Display photos of your family and friends or some unique keepsakes in your room. Seeing these items will elicit happy memories and improve chi flow.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Start improving your bedroom for better well being.</h1><p></p><p></p><p>These simple Feng Shui tips can be used to create good chi energy flow. These can help increase your energy levels and benefit your daily life overall. Remember that these guidelines are only a simplified version of Feng Shui, and the philosophy can get much more complex.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When you commit to adjusting your bedroom for Feng Shui — especially if the practice is still new to you — it's so easy to feel overwhelmed. But try not to be stressed out by the rules.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>It's okay if your bed is on a diagonal. It's okay if you can't fit two nightstands. It's okay if you don't have those peach accents. Don't stress yourself out over the simple things. Remember, every room, and every individual is different.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you've made Feng Shui changes that feel wrong to you, change them back if you can, or trust your instincts to adjust things in your bedroom so that they feel better for you. Follow the guidelines we've listed that are possible for you and experience how these ancient principles of Feng Shui can help transform your space, your state of mind, and your good night's sleep.</p><p></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__inner post__footer-inner"><div class="post__updated">Updated: <time datetime="2022-08-28T18:53">August 28, 2022</time></div><div class="post__actions"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button" aria-label="Share"><svg width="32" height="32"><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=How%20to%20Feng%20Shui%20Your%20Bedroom https%3A%2F%2Fchrisgliddon.github.io%2Fluckycathome%2Fhow-to-feng-shui-your-bedroom%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> WhatsApp</a></div></div></div></div><div class="post__inner author post__author"><div class="author__info"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/authors/melbren/" class="invert author__name" rel="author">Melbren</a></div></div></footer></article></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/feng-shui-basics-attracting-positive-energy-into-your-home/" rel="prev" class="post__nav-link"><span>Previous</span><h5 class="invert">Feng Shui Basics: Attracting Positive Energy Into Your Home</h5></a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/how-to-use-a-feng-shui-compass/" rel="next" class="post__nav-link"><span>Next</span><h5 class="invert">How to Use a Feng Shui Compass</h5></a></div></div></div></nav><div class="section section--light s-t-2 s-b-2 post__related"><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="h6 section__title">You may also like:</h3><div class="feed"><div class="feed post__related-feed"><div class="feed__item"><div class="feed__text"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/kua-number-calculator-how-to-find-your-feng-shui-kua-number/" class="invert">Kua Number Calculator: How to Find Your Feng Shui Kua Number</a></h3><p>In Feng Shui, there is a fundamental concept known as the "Kua Number".
