Your birth year is believed to significantly influence certain features, qualities, and abilities of an individual. It is also believed that having a better understanding of the Kua Number could help develop a person's potential and even overall life improvement.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you want to better understand the Kua number, here is a quick and simple guide about Kua Numbers and how to use a Kua Number calculator.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>What is my Kua number?&nbsp;</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Kua Numbers are also known as the Eight Mansions or Eight Houses Feng Shui. It is commonly used to determine the favorable directions you should face and locations for your house's essential areas, such as your bedroom and front door. This number also offers insight into your energetic compatibility with other people.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Your Kua number can also be called your Bagua number, ming gua, gua number, or personal trigram.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As mentioned earlier, your Kua number is determined by your birth year and your gender.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Why should I know my Kua number?</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The purpose of knowing your Kua number(pronounced as GWAH) is to make feng shui readings and adjustments that are specific to your PERSONALITY.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It is significant to know your Feng Shui Kua number because it is used to identify good or bad directions and locations for the places you spend most of your time. You can use these directions to your advantage by facing your best ones when you're working or studying or eating. Likewise, you should avoid staying or facing your bad directions and locations.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Through the interpretation of different combinations of the trigrams (the black line symbols), it is believed that humans can be guided to follow the path of least resistance through the energy offered by the influential forces of Earth (Yin) and heaven (Yang).</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/27/d5ECWw-17gNff2zluje2lddKEvAGXaR93c1uawo24ARU9bSMnDM5BvyZPc9suV3eiflDqT9vXWqgUdTOAfyX5GjZnuYN8JF-HoqKOZi2vvKNDVP3ihV1eO8Tv1Iep-PF8kWwfSS7" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>By organizing your areas of personal energy in a certain way, spending time, or even just facing these directions when you sleep or sit down, you can minimize the stress and create more joy in your life. You can use it to directly benefit you in your interior living space, whether it may be at home or at work. Applying Feng Shui using your Kua number is one of the best ways to use Feng Shui to improve your life.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It's great to make it a habit to use your Feng Shui Kua number as this is your specific Life Force Energy number. Then, arm yourself with a good feng shui compass to locate your best directions and spend as much time possible facing there.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>How to calculate your Kua number?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>The two main components of calculating your Kua number is your birth year and your gender.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Because this calculation uses the Chinese calendar, if you were born before February 4, (January 1 - February 3) you'll use the year prior. For example, you were born on January 12, 1976, you'll use 1975 for your birth year.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you 'e born after February 4, you can use the same birth year in your birth certificate or your real birth year.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Here's how you can calculate your Kua number.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Step 1: Turning your birth year to a single base number.</h2><p></p><p></p><p>You need to convert your birth year to a single-digit number. To do this, the first step id to add up the four digits of your birth year.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In this case, we'll use the year 1995.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1+9+9+5 = 24</p><p></p><p></p><p>Because 24 still has two digits, you should add up the two digits again as follows:&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>2+4 = 6</p><p></p><p></p><p>6 is the base number that you will be using in Step 2.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Step 2: Finding your Kua number based on gender</h2><p></p><p></p><p>This part uses your gender for calculation. If you prefer to identify with another gender, you use what you're most comfortable with.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>For males, subtract your base number from eleven.</li><li>For females, add four to your base number.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Using the base number we got from step 1, we will get these Kua numbers:</p><p></p><p></p><p>Male: 11 – 6 = 5</p><p></p><p></p><p>Female: 4 + 6 = 10</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you get a single-digit number in this step, then you have your Kua number. Otherwise, you need to proceed to step 3.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> 5 is basically a non-existent number. If you get 5 as a Kua number, you need to convert it to the following:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Male: 5 = 2</li><li>Female: 5 = 8</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>In the case above, our result for the male Kua computation is 5, so we need to convert it to 2 since it's for a male Kua number.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That makes it 2 as the Kua number for the male born in 1995.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/27/zd3ECaxTNtcocQ5zrX78bNpfCWWnwa-EV3piuZCHZOmMCh9CKFpXrGQ-Cb8ExyNAg0pNjIhLWxjTJmgb43CKA3bouoFkC39yNBt50JWxqBgPpwmK-to5u26bzJ2LEHEO7_tgputu" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><h2>Step 3: Confirming your Kua number</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The Kua number must be a single digit, which means it should be between 1-9 only. Since we got 10 as the sum for the Female Kua number in the example above, we should subtract 9 to get the right Kua number. The same method applies to male Kua numbers as well.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In this case, 10-9 = 1.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1 is the right or final Kua number for the Female born in 1995.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you're still confused with the computation, you can also use a <a href="https://redlotusletter.com/resources/kua-calculator/">Kua number calculator</a>. All you need to do is input your birthdate and gender, and the program will compute the Kua number for you.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>What does your Kua number mean?</h1><p></p><p></p><h2>Two groups of Feng Shui Kua number</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The Feng Shui Kua Number is divided people into 2 groups - the East and West groups.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Those with Kua number is 1, 3, 4, 9, or a 5 (male) belong to the East group.</li><li>While those with Kua number is 2, 6, 7, 8, or a 5 (female) belong to the West group.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>The four auspicious directions of the East group include North, South, East, and Southeast.

Remember, Your Kua number a great way to use Feng Shui for your personal benefit, but don't force it to apply on everything you own.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>You'd never want to move your bed to a windowed wall just because it's in your auspicious direction. Same as turning your desk to the door because it will activate your success direction. This will result in poor placement — and that in itself brings bad luck and problems! So, don't be tempted.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When you have something placed in an unlucky location, don't fret too much. What's important to remember is that every corner of the home should be activated – even the ones that are in a loss direction. All you need to do is find Feng Shui cures to contradict the misplacement, and everything will be okay.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Have you found your Kua number?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>The Feng Shui Kua Number is a powerful tool to apply Feng Shui for your own benefit. You can use it even in simple ways, such as what direction you should face when you’re sitting at your desk or sleeping in your bed.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>But if following it starts to become complicated and difficult, consider taking a step back and look at the bigger picture. Let the wisdom of using it help you rather than hold you back.</p><p></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__inner post__footer-inner"><div class="post__updated">Updated: <time datetime="2022-08-28T18:53">August 28, 2022</time></div><div class="post__actions"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button" aria-label="Share"><svg width="32" height="32"><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Kua%20Number%20Calculator%3A%20How%20to%20Find%20Your%20Feng%20Shui%20Kua%20Number https%3A%2F%2Fchrisgliddon.github.io%2Fluckycathome%2Fkua-number-calculator-how-to-find-your-feng-shui-kua-number.html" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> WhatsApp</a></div></div></div></div><div class="post__inner author post__author"><div class="author__info"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/authors/melbren/" class="invert author__name" rel="author">Melbren</a></div></div></footer></article></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/how-to-wear-a-feng-shui-pixiu-mantra-ring.html" rel="prev" class="post__nav-link"><span>Previous</span><h5 class="invert">How to Wear a Feng Shui Pixiu Mantra Ring</h5></a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/how-to-make-lavender-essential-oils.html" rel="next" class="post__nav-link"><span>Next</span><h5 class="invert">How to Make Lavender Essential Oils</h5></a></div></div></div></nav><div class="section section--light s-t-2 s-b-2 post__related"><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="h6 section__title">You may also like:</h3><div class="feed"><div class="feed post__related-feed"><div class="feed__item"><div class="feed__text"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/how-to-wear-a-feng-shui-pixiu-mantra-ring.html" class="invert">How to Wear a Feng Shui Pixiu Mantra Ring</a></h3><p>There are many charms, bracelets, and other accessories related to Feng Shui.
