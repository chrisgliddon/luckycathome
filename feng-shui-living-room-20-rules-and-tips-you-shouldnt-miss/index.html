It is where you usually hang out and accept guests for social gatherings. That's why it is crucial to make it comfortable and enjoyable for everyone.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Pez3DS4hGg-TT2qhEe5gQcxFbSzg1fn6j2oKhhi2YLmva9kyAA2lziKRi_v4JjWGCUxhDOSNt3LzhmfT8cX52yljlveg9p6l__40PERWg3RXOJYKC1ZyJ7z8ZgX8glQ7g9K4RG8q" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Pez3DS4hGg-TT2qhEe5gQcxFbSzg1fn6j2oKhhi2YLmva9kyAA2lziKRi_v4JjWGCUxhDOSNt3LzhmfT8cX52yljlveg9p6l__40PERWg3RXOJYKC1ZyJ7z8ZgX8glQ7g9K4RG8q"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>More than just properly arranging furniture and painting walls, finding the perfect balance between the energy and objects in your living room is necessary. Achieving this balance can be done through <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/index.php/2020/08/12/feng-shui-basics-attracting-positive-energy-into-your-home/">Feng Shui</a>. No worries, you don't need to be a Feng Shui expert to start, you can actually do it yourself.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To help you create balance and welcome positive energy, here are some Feng Shui rules and tips you should follow for your living room. We will talk about location, placement, furniture, and overall vibes.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>How can I Feng Shui in my living room?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>The first thing you should consider is the location of your living room. </p><p></p><p></p><h2>1. Your living room should be in the front part of your house</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Your living room should be the first room to welcome anyone who's coming into your house. Ideally, it should be close to the front door.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>2. Clear clutter</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WFIx3mV2m1e54o-oc6lxnGmzi2sk5-9SYmuQN3q8Q5GA9kWjAThwoKYeBPnCM9VTyKoeJvnz0pzM9HKdq5dKPm_R5jtqjcDpMRm-yxTnCfE7P_HRsYleCr6mQ6D8ooJX4wXhjFUu" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is WFIx3mV2m1e54o-oc6lxnGmzi2sk5-9SYmuQN3q8Q5GA9kWjAThwoKYeBPnCM9VTyKoeJvnz0pzM9HKdq5dKPm_R5jtqjcDpMRm-yxTnCfE7P_HRsYleCr6mQ6D8ooJX4wXhjFUu"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The primary principle of Feng Shui is to create spatial harmony. Thus, to achieve a good living room feng shui, you must declutter the space. Having many unnecessary objects around could disrupt the flow of energy in your living room.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To keep the positive vibe and good chi energy flowing, try getting rid of some excess furniture or any other object with no specific function in the room.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>3. Your living room should have four corners</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Many modern design houses have irregular shaped living rooms. Some come in triangular, round, and other irregular shapes. This is not ideal in Feng Shui. Your living room should have four corners like a square, rectangle, or other four-cornered shapes. These shapes are believed to attract people who are more virtuous or righteous.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>4. It should be in an auspicious area based on Personal and House Kua</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Besides your bedroom, your living room is most likely the room you'll spend most of your time in. Therefore, it is best if it's located in an auspicious area inside your home. You can check this by knowing your Kua number or the facing direction of your home and see if it is in the ideal location.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In case your living room is not in a favorable location, You can make some adjustments based on your Kua number. But keep in mind that your sofa needs to be placed conveniently. Don't force it if the placing looks too awkward for the layout of your living room. Besides, comfort is your primary target here.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>5. Avoid low and slanted ceiling</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SRHA4BFYiUh3aH10AJkOGCS5jjpwkKoziwJl54U76S3lK4-4TxUvTJTEnsrAlsgDb1eksicA5UyLLwoCXSSHpgFm3J_UDy5XwOaFYlHVeVMQx-sIsbrBpj6dAtWw3Z88vY9IYADf" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is SRHA4BFYiUh3aH10AJkOGCS5jjpwkKoziwJl54U76S3lK4-4TxUvTJTEnsrAlsgDb1eksicA5UyLLwoCXSSHpgFm3J_UDy5XwOaFYlHVeVMQx-sIsbrBpj6dAtWw3Z88vY9IYADf"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Low ceilings give off a negative vibe, which makes you feel too compressed. It could make you and your guests feel uncomfortable because of the invisible pressure. It will also make it hard for energy to flow and gather in the space because it feels small.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Aside from low ceilings, avoid slanted ceilings too because they give off the same vibe. But if your living room was made with slanted ceilings, try your best not to put your sofa underneath the slanted parts. </p><p></p><p></p><h2>6. Your living room should have multiple windows</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Having a single window on an area for multiple people can be quite sad. It's also wrong in Feng Shui because the positive Chi energy won't flow freely. This could affect your ability to make social connections. Thus, the occupant(s) might become more of a loner and avoid human interaction.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Which direction should my couch face?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>The sofa is the biggest and is the most essential furniture in your living room, that's why it's placement is crucial. But how should you position it? Here are some tips.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>7. Use the command position on your sofa</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Similarly, on how to <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/index.php/2020/08/13/feng-shui-bed-placement-tips-for-good-luck/">position your bed in Feng Shui</a>, the sofa in your living room should also be in the command position.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/J_pQMTnzR0xd1kUbFQj2V1oTAp_TRu0HuovjgHgQGMGD_W__ik3I77uui0kVQlc4m2mIF9psueI7j2r7z02LYUNjV97CN4ljXNRSZncPyLaVu7otQZ3Toqu2n6dyW54ZfWu8SjWF" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is J_pQMTnzR0xd1kUbFQj2V1oTAp_TRu0HuovjgHgQGMGD_W__ik3I77uui0kVQlc4m2mIF9psueI7j2r7z02LYUNjV97CN4ljXNRSZncPyLaVu7otQZ3Toqu2n6dyW54ZfWu8SjWF"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Basically, the command position is placing an object (in this case, the sofa) on an area where you can see the front door. However, your sofa shouldn't be directly in line with the door. The ideal position is setting the sofa or couch with a wall behind it. The person sitting on it should be able to see the front door directly. That's your command position.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you can't position your sofa against a wall, support it using large furniture like a table or cabinet and put it behind the backrest.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>8. Avoid placing your sofa directly in front of a door</h2><p></p><p></p><p>This rule is connected to the previous one. If you follow the command position, you shouldn't put your sofa directly in-line with a door. More so, if your front door leads to a narrow hallway that leads to the couch. This forms an arrow position that builds negative energy - something you wouldn't want in your living room.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Suppose you can't avoid having your sofa directly in line with the door. Then you can just make a remedy by placing a divider or other furniture somewhere in the middle.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>9. Avoid having a walkway behind the sofa</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Having a walkway behind your sofa makes you more vulnerable. It could also attract people that might do you harm (in different ways). Doing this could also make it harder for you to get help and from your friends. Ensure there is support or a wall behind your couch (just like what we mentioned in #5). </p><p></p><p></p><h2>10. Avoid placing your sofa under a beam</h2><p></p><p></p><p>In Feng Shui, beams are believed to bring a form of negative energy (Xa) that can cause issues to your health. Some also say that staying under a beam will put you in a situation where you are "forced to submit, bow, and concede." This is why it is best if you avoid placing your sofa under a beam. </p><p></p><p></p><h1>Where should I put my TV in my living room?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Your TV should also be strategically positioned as it affects the overall vibe of your living room. Here are some proper TV placement tips you should follow. </p><p></p><p></p><h2>11. Choose an auspicious area</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Following the Feng Shui Bagua, here are different auspicious directions you can place your TV:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li><strong>North</strong> - This is the career side. You can place your TV in this position to attract good luck in one's career.</li><li><strong>South</strong> - This side corresponds to fame and recognition. If you wish to enhance your opportunity for fame and respect, put it in this area.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h2>12. Avoid putting your TV above the fireplace</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vWPrn_7tMTcFWg-SbTadCsUcWdv70nPqCdQohvSmhK3B0urP5P4jI1koHO1U6Z6jlp5-nS_dICMeLLzktF_iCSSmJQ1lIe-RlunBi0mLFnM1h2WcPFNHldbPt9sK1t0HXo6oF5sG" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is vWPrn_7tMTcFWg-SbTadCsUcWdv70nPqCdQohvSmhK3B0urP5P4jI1koHO1U6Z6jlp5-nS_dICMeLLzktF_iCSSmJQ1lIe-RlunBi0mLFnM1h2WcPFNHldbPt9sK1t0HXo6oF5sG"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>A TV above the fireplace is a big no-no in Feng Shui for two reasons:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>The electricity of the TV creates excess heat. It is not an ideal combination with the "Fiery" symbolism of the fireplace.</li><li>It might not be a comfortable viewing position.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h1>Where should Feng Shui plants be placed indoors?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Plants have amazing benefits not only to your living room's visual appeal but also to your health. To get the best out of your Feng Shui indoor plants, here are some tips on positioning them.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>13. Use large potted plants</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Large plants bring in more energy in a room, so large plants are suitable in the living room. Jut remember not to put large plants on the following areas:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Southwest</li><li>Northeast</li><li>Northwest</li><li>Center</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Putting plants in these areas may bring in some adverse effects that could affect your marriage and your children's ability to learn (Southwest and Northeast). Putting plants that clash with the prominent element in an area (like gold in the northwest)can negatively affect the energy in your living room.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But if you still want to put plants in these areas, you can always do so. But choose smaller plants instead.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>14. Choose plants with round leaves</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Choose plants with large rounded leaves because it's believed to have the ability to attract positive energies. It's best to avoid pointy leaves because they are considered a bad form in Feng Shui.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>15. Make a small window garden</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/m7QXByb3iSj59CaWFPlyzMcEluVtGxgeroV0WfcD0EimYAjeWhzuV10x9yGpqJha1PWynjnOR1epfu8Meu66uDcXGq5NamAikAs0z2f93rVt433hVgKMBGmMpeiIz2SC0txdvu-y" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is m7QXByb3iSj59CaWFPlyzMcEluVtGxgeroV0WfcD0EimYAjeWhzuV10x9yGpqJha1PWynjnOR1epfu8Meu66uDcXGq5NamAikAs0z2f93rVt433hVgKMBGmMpeiIz2SC0txdvu-y"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>If your living room is small and doesn't have enough space for large plants, you can set up a small garden near your window. Put some small potted plants and flowers near your window, or maybe some herbs.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Plants absorb negative energy and clean the air, so putting it, even in a small room, it's great for you overall. </p><p></p><p></p><h1>How to make my living room look attractive?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Adding decorations and other elements won't only affect the look of your living, it could also enhance the flow of positive chi energy. Here are Feng Shui tips on how you can decorate and make your living room more attractive.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>16. Have lots of lighting</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Bring in some bright, uplifting energy using natural light and layered lighting. Try to put lighting on dark corners to brighten it up. Light also represents the fire element, which should be represented in your living room for harmony and balance.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>17. Put some rug for grounding</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Putting a rug in the living room grounds space. You should choose a flat square-shaped rug. This brings in the earth element of stability and good health.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>18. Choose uplifting artwork</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Choose uplifting and personal artwork. You can go for scenic pictures, quotations or just art that you really enjoy. You can also use family pictures since they are considered excellent in Feng Shui, but it isn't necessarily required. Also, make sure you don't hang them too low. Artworks hanging low can cause depression in the home. </p><p></p><p></p><h2>19. Use expansive mirrors</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UytKxAQeTI8qGJjMmjn177igWrc1PDxseqZHofQ6-QhhH0lJPXRpOmNe8JkrFv8fVCGFrL6oXKR03zAyWMMx3JETH6z-xax5f61LOVJ1qSxBgomo4w4aphU-Sf80POyVEN53NpKm" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is UytKxAQeTI8qGJjMmjn177igWrc1PDxseqZHofQ6-QhhH0lJPXRpOmNe8JkrFv8fVCGFrL6oXKR03zAyWMMx3JETH6z-xax5f61LOVJ1qSxBgomo4w4aphU-Sf80POyVEN53NpKm"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Mirrors can make a room feel bigger. If possible, hang your mirror near a window to bounce natural light into the room. If you have a landscape outside, try to position our mirror where it reflects the view. This would attract more positive energy into your home.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You should also choose a mirror that reflects your entire head, shoulders, and chest line to ensure you 'capture your aura.'</p><p></p><p></p><h2>20. Incorporate the five elements</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Create the right balance by incorporating the five elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water) in your living room through decors. Try to use decorations representing each element, whether it may be furniture, accessories, art, and more. Try to use a Feng Shui map or Bagua to track the best locations of where to put them.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Set up that relaxing living room!</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Living rooms are mainly for entertainment and relaxation. But unlike the bedroom, living rooms are meant to be shared with others.

Now go set up your living room and have fun!</p><p></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__inner post__footer-inner"><div class="post__updated">Updated: <time datetime="2022-08-29T20:21">August 29, 2022</time></div><div class="post__actions"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button" aria-label="Share"><svg width="32" height="32"><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Feng%20Shui%20Living%20Room%3A%2020%20Rules%20and%20Tips%20You%20Shouldn't%20Miss https%3A%2F%2Fchrisgliddon.github.io%2Fluckycathome%2Ffeng-shui-living-room-20-rules-and-tips-you-shouldnt-miss%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> WhatsApp</a></div></div></div></div><div class="post__inner author post__author"><div class="author__info"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/authors/melbren/" class="invert author__name" rel="author">Melbren</a></div></div></footer></article></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/5-natural-ways-to-get-rid-of-ants-in-your-bedroom/" rel="prev" class="post__nav-link"><span>Previous</span><h5 class="invert">5 Natural Ways to Get Rid of Ants in Your Bedroom</h5></a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/5-easy-ways-to-open-a-locked-bedroom-door/" rel="next" class="post__nav-link"><span>Next</span><h5 class="invert">5 Easy Ways to Open a Locked Bedroom Door</h5></a></div></div></div></nav><div class="section section--light s-t-2 s-b-2 post__related"><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="h6 section__title">You may also like:</h3><div class="feed"><div class="feed post__related-feed"><div class="feed__item"><div class="feed__text"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/kua-number-calculator-how-to-find-your-feng-shui-kua-number/" class="invert">Kua Number Calculator: How to Find Your Feng Shui Kua Number</a></h3><p>In Feng Shui, there is a fundamental concept known as the "Kua Number".
