Oh yeah, the anger. The frustration. Yes, I feel you (hugs).</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you're having trouble getting that calm and peaceful vibe in your bedroom because of external disturbances, like noise, maybe it's time to consider soundproofing your room. Here are some effective DIY tips on how you could soundproof your room.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>What is soundproofing?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Soundproofing is a method of reducing or removing any unwanted noise from your house, office, and general vicinity. It is often achieved using insulative materials to reflect, suppress, diffuse, and absorb sounds or noises coming from a source.</p><p></p><p></p><p>There are two types of noises you can encounter in terms of bedroom soundproofing - impact noise and airborne noise.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Impact noises</strong> are sounds created by an impact like footsteps, dropped heavy objects overhead, or crazy neighbors bouncing off the walls. <strong>Airborne noises</strong>, on the other hand, comes from honking car horns, car alarms, the sound of shouting drunken nightclubbers outside, or from a TV in the next room. </p><p></p><p></p><p>These two are the noises you'd want to avoid or conceal with soundproofing.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Why should I soundproof my bedroom?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>There are actually many benefits to soundproofing your room. And among them are the following:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>You'll have a more quiet and peaceful environment.</li><li>It'll allow you to have a better sleep.</li><li>Provides more privacy</li><li>It will also allow you to make noises (even on late nights) without disturbing other people in the house or your neighbors.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>The best part of this is, you can actually do it yourself without spending too much.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To sum it all up, soundproofing will make your room quieter and private while also allowing you to make (loud) noises without getting complaints from anyone. A total win-win, right?</p><p></p><p></p><h1>How to soundproof my bedroom?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Since we're talking about soundproofing your own bedroom, we'll focus on ways to soundproof from the INSIDE. To do that, we must first identify the main points that can make a place feel noisy.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>1. Source of the sound</h2><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QpT6WUrzyphMZySaFE7A1nKMs1G9nEr0-f8aNH7wSIQbp_LVKPqpHETfUK1RCI2G-smIr5oMU9wC5giq6e8Xn-r9T3TVVNPhtHLIoCP4_bLO1wRepMn_ADDm3uoALz8s5D5o9dm8" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is QpT6WUrzyphMZySaFE7A1nKMs1G9nEr0-f8aNH7wSIQbp_LVKPqpHETfUK1RCI2G-smIr5oMU9wC5giq6e8Xn-r9T3TVVNPhtHLIoCP4_bLO1wRepMn_ADDm3uoALz8s5D5o9dm8"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/13/QpT6WUrzyphMZySaFE7A1nKMs1G9nEr0-f8aNH7wSIQbp_LVKPqpHETfUK1RCI2G-smIr5oMU9wC5giq6e8Xn-r9T3TVVNPhtHLIoCP4_bLO1wRepMn_ADDm3uoALz8s5D5o9dm8" alt=""></figure></div><p></p><p></p><p>You must first identify the potential sources of noise. If we're dealing with noises from your room, these could come from your TV or an instrument. If it's outside, this can come from different things like cars, animals, your neighbors.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Knowing the source will make it easier for you to contain the sound, especially when it's coming from a specific spot.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>2. Entry point</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The entry point is where the sound could enter to your room. These could be specific areas that are adjacent to the source of the sound like windows or doors. It could also be an entire wall, which is common on shared walls in condos, apartments, or duplexes.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>3. Reflection point</h2><p></p><p></p><p>When the sound enters your room, it will bounce off to a surface known as the reflection point. Sounds bounce back at the same angle of entry. So if it enters a straight line, it will most likely bounce back as a straight line. Identifying the reflection points will help you strategize on where to put soundproofing materials better.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Effective ways to soundproof your bedroom</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Now, we will talk about different ways on how to effectively soundproof your bedroom. These are easy and affordable techniques that you can do yourself. </p><p></p><p></p><h2>1. Seal your door</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Your door most likely has gaps around it, most commonly at the bottom, causing an air leak. Sounds travel through the air, so if it has air leak, sound can probably pass through the gaps.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can check this by standing inside your room with the door closed and the lights off. If you see some light shining through the edges of your door, it does have an air leak that sound can travel through.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cz1fEmhISp1LvDc_p-fwuZAOyx5nIvZVqcrak13TLWgfgOh6MVHDltcgKhas2XilwU0AL_pcNJ_vt8NWPd_ylnYP69545J3weHfHBLgTDdaw32pkWpTL7DQXfF2unzyAVVksjQXS" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is cz1fEmhISp1LvDc_p-fwuZAOyx5nIvZVqcrak13TLWgfgOh6MVHDltcgKhas2XilwU0AL_pcNJ_vt8NWPd_ylnYP69545J3weHfHBLgTDdaw32pkWpTL7DQXfF2unzyAVVksjQXS"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>To fix this, you can put a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Rice-Adhesive-Stripping-Soundproof/dp/B072QDSJKT/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=soundproofxpert-20&amp;linkId=517436a041b629973cfb0b41996f6b71">door sweep</a> at the bottom of your door. These are cheap and do a petty good job at concealing gaps. You can also put some weather stripping seal tape around the edges of your door to better seal them. It's also highly suggested to have more solid wooden doors to make sound penetrate less.  </p><p></p><p></p><h2>2. Seal your windows</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BbWvBvKBWBVDMHm9l1qulc_47yX0_Z8D1RNGY9yEidD_sVTTH6fl10ojR1fV8RD28DDGhDuPmYf5gRCNLqdazQ6Hh65b5yu7YfUwsQxW0ENOGD9WZ_sfxEkK5oHGkC-gaO9Xxsx6" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is BbWvBvKBWBVDMHm9l1qulc_47yX0_Z8D1RNGY9yEidD_sVTTH6fl10ojR1fV8RD28DDGhDuPmYf5gRCNLqdazQ6Hh65b5yu7YfUwsQxW0ENOGD9WZ_sfxEkK5oHGkC-gaO9Xxsx6"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>No, we don't mean you seal them shut permanently. Just like the door, your widows might have some gaps where sound can pass through. To fix this, you can also put in some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trim-Lok-D-Shaped-Rubber-Seal-Thick/dp/B00NL49QCA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534446337&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=door+seal&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=generatorgrid-20&amp;linkId=f147e37e2086a4195b9590d441c5fa31">weather stripping seal tape</a> around the edges of your windows to seal them.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>3. Put padding on your floor and ceiling</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SCYF5o7AErnJkoX3BUj23GKYlzzGGwH3Sw6P8tIPQwbSFQutLHb55TBkkBZb7Z69fP8ihb09JV6mflwpoy5ZvyFww9sCPBsa7Bx1QB3jXUSoG_yGb_aiKj6miPY5IND_k1MQ4W0" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is -SCYF5o7AErnJkoX3BUj23GKYlzzGGwH3Sw6P8tIPQwbSFQutLHb55TBkkBZb7Z69fP8ihb09JV6mflwpoy5ZvyFww9sCPBsa7Bx1QB3jXUSoG_yGb_aiKj6miPY5IND_k1MQ4W0"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>If noises come from your neighbors above, you may want to consider putting some padding on your ceiling, like these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonex-WWC-2-Whisper-Wave-Clouds/dp/B07CKKDZ84/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=soundproofxpert-20&amp;linkId=e5872198de3d90a1cb3bf2f88fb8ab37">ceiling clouds</a>. These work nicely and help with footstep noises coming from above.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But if you're the one on the upper apartment and your neighbors below are making noises, invest in some thick and heavy carpets/rugs. Not only will it help minimize the noise coming from below, but it will also help conceal noises coming from your floor. They do make a big difference, especially when you put an extra soundproofing vinyl under your rug.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>4. Use thick curtains</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9JTicIU3r0OARrhajvGfPOofsCKwu8k3fb9NKLzdQWSv3GrmmHs0RX6DJmff-TCV51zhOu2ej5K4l3PCZG6MlscawbOjp3K_2ec4wh66GzpN10bdzISFanI46s3H9FvVl1Z4vHjC" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 9JTicIU3r0OARrhajvGfPOofsCKwu8k3fb9NKLzdQWSv3GrmmHs0RX6DJmff-TCV51zhOu2ej5K4l3PCZG6MlscawbOjp3K_2ec4wh66GzpN10bdzISFanI46s3H9FvVl1Z4vHjC"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Special <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NICETOWN-Microfiber-Reducing-Insulated-Blackout/dp/B01CS31NDE/ref=sr_1_6?crid=310GR2HSKKAZN&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=soundproof+curtains+noise+cancelling&amp;qid=1598037118&amp;sprefix=soundproof+curtains%2Caps%2C436&amp;sr=8-6">thick soundproofing curtains</a> don't only help minimize sounds, they also work as great blackout curtains. These curtains can help absorb extra sound from the outside and the ambient noise that floats around your room.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The greater the density of your curtains, the better. Instead of using just 2 drapes, you can use 4 drapes to increase the curtains' mass.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>5. Hang acoustic panels or foam</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7x-mwpJLgKrFlgsiEuSCAxZ-Oc2WtKvyKPauPqDjB7scZETNlTjU5DVk5_y7sJKWQeSL53LQGrnzJUOU4TK7INdMCUH21Tsxv0lWg7jJSpzpWBAUHUY88Ktj4-SHIW2DXFUsp997" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is 7x-mwpJLgKrFlgsiEuSCAxZ-Oc2WtKvyKPauPqDjB7scZETNlTjU5DVk5_y7sJKWQeSL53LQGrnzJUOU4TK7INdMCUH21Tsxv0lWg7jJSpzpWBAUHUY88Ktj4-SHIW2DXFUsp997"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Hard surfaces can reflect and amplify sounds. You can invest in some cheap <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=soundproof+foam">acoustic panel or foam</a> to help elevate your soundproofing. These are soft, which absorb more sound, making them bounce a lot less. These panels come in a lot of colors and designs and help add some aesthetic to your room.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You don't have to cover all your walls with this material. You can just place them on the reflection point of the sound, usually the opposite wall of the source.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>6. Hang some canvas art</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SmN6wrlxT-ilOK8hsUFRuPGVhgNdXbjQuphajsnBi6gxCJ_7Ir1aEaJ6lzGkUYV29LdSFCbuH_NnlxmlyLB8mevwWjZVYiZ7570Cj8E5-zRgDJ2WzPzlGR3B2RYSUGy8DXWBjJUB" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is SmN6wrlxT-ilOK8hsUFRuPGVhgNdXbjQuphajsnBi6gxCJ_7Ir1aEaJ6lzGkUYV29LdSFCbuH_NnlxmlyLB8mevwWjZVYiZ7570Cj8E5-zRgDJ2WzPzlGR3B2RYSUGy8DXWBjJUB"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>If you're not into acoustic panels, you can also try hanging some canvas art. Painting, posters printed on canvas, etc. are excellent alternatives. Not only do these help absorb sound, but they are also very pleasing to the eyes.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Remember that soft and deeply textured materials are much better than hard, smooth materials because they can absorb sound a lot better. Aside from canvas art, you can also use some tapestry and hang them on your wall. </p><p></p><p></p><h2>7. Put on some background noise</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IAe3rqoRRvfe4fKzeKhbkVm-kz2wKo6I8eSKt2GjJguUVa7Z0sSn_1Fq8Tc7s4vJjy6NHRBjignE04R6r-smB0kPu0UfQW29AsHqotGRQClUgzgKgZgmsvzALOrIGuGvLGfybG7t" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is IAe3rqoRRvfe4fKzeKhbkVm-kz2wKo6I8eSKt2GjJguUVa7Z0sSn_1Fq8Tc7s4vJjy6NHRBjignE04R6r-smB0kPu0UfQW29AsHqotGRQClUgzgKgZgmsvzALOrIGuGvLGfybG7t"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>When you have something else to listen to, it becomes easier to drown out the more annoying sounds around. You can purchase a <a href="https://amzn.to/2C6oSSh?tag=moderncastle-20">sound machine</a> that plays a variety of background noises like rain, white noise, fireplace, and more. These are relatively cheap and are an excellent quick fix that can be useful, especially for temporary situations.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>8. Add furniture</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ys2Jz5lQQ-_SvO2vUBiO2iiKQbEM-S6fRZWOtBeBBb9cGx-Lq5bRLT2KaS3ZkRaVWvW_RlF3LD64qHU9HQgOsVRXxpmIIyYS2v4e-tPhFJQXpPHkVSDI8vidhZvp04n0azwu6_5H" data-is-external-image="true" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is ys2Jz5lQQ-_SvO2vUBiO2iiKQbEM-S6fRZWOtBeBBb9cGx-Lq5bRLT2KaS3ZkRaVWvW_RlF3LD64qHU9HQgOsVRXxpmIIyYS2v4e-tPhFJQXpPHkVSDI8vidhZvp04n0azwu6_5H"></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>If you have more vacant space in your bedroom, you can also add more furniture. Upholstered furniture like chairs or sofa is highly recommended because it keeps sounds from bouncing as much and gives more areas for sound to be absorbed into. If you don't have more room for a sofa or chair, you can add more pillows and thick blankets on your bed.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can also opt for floor-to-ceiling shelvings and fill them with a lot of books and magazines. You can also use the shelves as storage space. It could help absorb sound more efficiently.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Another tip if you're a bit extra</h1><p></p><p></p><p>If you have that extra budget to spend, add another layer of drywall to your entire room. It will help lessen the sound vibrations. Apply some caulk in between sheets of drywall to help with the absorption of the sound from outside.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Apply about 3/8 inch-thick of acoustical caulk to keep the sounds at bay. When done, refinish and repaint the drywall you've installed on an existing wall and extend the electrical outlets for easier access.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But this isn't necessary. This requires quite some work, so you can just consider it when all else fails.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Time to get better sleep with bedroom soundproofing</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Your bedroom is a safe haven. It's totally okay to take some extra steps to try and upgrade it. Like <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/index.php/2020/08/13/feng-shui-bed-placement-tips-for-good-luck/">finding the right position of your bed</a> or soundproofing your entire room to make you feel more relaxed and comfortable.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Soundproofing doesn't require a lot of money or expertise. You can fairly do it by yourself with the help of the right materials and a bit of time. Do know that doing these tips won't totally block all the noises from outside.
