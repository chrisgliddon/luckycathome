Would you believe that these energies could walk right into your doorstep?</p><p></p><p></p><p>This was deemed possible through Fung Shui and the proper placement of some elements in your room. You can achieve by using a Feng Shui compass.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In this article, well talk about how to use a Feng shui compass and what benefits it could bring to your home.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Feng Shui and compass reading</h1><p></p><p></p><p>The word Feng Shui literally translates into ‘wind’ and ‘water.’ It is an ancient art that originated in China, combining science and spirituality.</p><p></p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/index.php/2020/08/12/feng-shui-basics-attracting-positive-energy-into-your-home/">Practicing Feng Shui</a> involves the understanding and correct placement of everything in your environment, and it usually consists of the use of a Feng Shui Compass.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This process means designing your space to optimize the balance and harmony between energies in your surroundings and your own energy.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>What compass should I use?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>There are different types of compasses you can use that are available in the market. Here are some of them:</p><p></p><p></p><h2>1. Luo Pan: Traditional Feng Shui Compass</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/5/JQrIQ5MvCr1t4IDQ3N9K_dW4WhT6EG-egj2OKGyhmc4VEgQBRWRUsVMfdAhn9F-ClLWAuNMqYHZxEsUAvy6p5Fk_DEpeCQfUBJfskghjGgx6KOT-AcwUpZrtKZRM9KuqGqXnN1vO" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>The Luo Pan or (Lo'pan) works like an ordinary compass with needles and indicates direction using the Earth's magnetic field. However, this compass is surrounded by a metal plate divided into several concentric rings engraved with information.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Usually, you'll see dispositions like the 8 directions, the 8 trigrams, the 24 directions, or mountains. You can also see astrological data as the 28 constellations, the earthly branches, the celestial trunks, and many other concepts applied in Feng Shui.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Different types of Luo Pan differ mainly on the kind of rings they incorporate.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>2. Magnetic needle compass</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/5/FrPUSB9m873K9bHtwA9Z58TEJIKBvlsiLE611AMPvYdO_oub8dykbMpfZLDLvTP3Od4ZY9jBNG-02rmhGLSy1WAGA-7HClg6dYYsuqi7KBUXHeJFOQHIcgtcYnd6KjX9sTtPJ-S2" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>A magnetic needle compass is usually divided into two colors: red and black—the red points to the north magnetic pole and the black points to the south magnetic pole. Aside from the needle, there is also a rotating ring that revolves 360 degrees. You can set this manually to get a reference of the degrees.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Some Chinese compasses that are similar to this use of white and red colors. The white color points to the north and the red points to the south.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>3. Magnetic disk compass</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/5/y_U1xXjph15HtW6hL_ablRiTjVLXEmiy7BwEVg75ZUGD-Ksqjt61LJ0QOmSQi-vQbyGUt_13zd8t9zrPUKTbG_ZSVuROyrcSsFUt8BJ3_b-JZTvfAAZv1KURPhiMfsRb7UR63XQe" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>A magnetic disk compass uses a rotating magnetic disk with the degrees listed on it instead of a magnetic needle.&nbsp; This prevents unnecessary adjustments of the needle to an outer ring, which is more convenient.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You only need to point the compass toward a specific position and wait until the ring stays still reading later the degrees. This system can be found in situations where manual adjustment is not practical, like on ships, cars, aircraft, etc.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>4. Compass apps</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/5/w0f56OhGaQiPO2NfragpSD_poD3vdzM-mGxbmWrXfI3qBDflb91gKVTD28YO7iDRMWIrEXPx9Yq8LVnWlsGqEZ_FoFKLtNcvsj872vqkH-nCoxkgO3hzP7PoSylhv7f5xniGV4fb" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>When you don't have access to a physical compass similar to the ones mentioned above, you can try downloading a compass app on your smartphone. If you don't have a built-in one, you can download it instead. Here are some of our recommendations:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pro.app.compass&amp;hl=en">Compass 360 Pro Free</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.nenter.app.compass_app">Compass Galaxy</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ite.compass">Digital Compass 360 Free</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplywerx.compass3d">Compass Steel 3D</a></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>If you use a smartphone compass, check the settings and make sure the" true north" option is turned off.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Since Feng Shui requires accurate location reading, it's still highly suggested to use a physical compass.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Which way is my house facing?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>To get the right Feng Shui compass reading, you must locate the facing direction of your house. Some say that the facing direction of your home is where your front door is located.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But that isn't exactly true.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Because of modern housing layout and style, your house's actual facing direction can be different from the facing direction of your front door.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/5/c9QAB-91N3UDDtzuEsE_Ov_xNOs8ViXw6L2pJbAymQDOntQc0cejs64ft9tZE91mNp-vYlESTJF9TTJ0o2jEw0yGnI9OJF8i2EWl4xkIeHPAGriq2mucM12_PTTHEvbPiePBUI_u" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><h2>Finding Yang side</h2><p></p><p></p><p>In Feng Shui, it's believed that every house has a 'Yin' and 'Yang' side. The Yin is known as the sitting direction where more quiet energy resides, while the Yang is known as the active energy. Knowing the facing direction of your home is also locating the 'Yang' side.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Yang (facing): </strong>This has the most active and lively energy, it is usually faced to:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>A public footpath.</li><li>A busy road.</li><li>A flowing river.</li><li>A nice view.</li><li>Your street sign.</li><li>A children’s playground or primary school.</li><li>The side with the most windows.</li><li>A living or family room is usually on the facing side.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>The Yang facing side is usually where the road or where more movement occurs. Say, for example, your front door is located on the west, but your house's direction towards the main road is north, then your house's facing direction is north, not west.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/5/HUKK0DVUPQDG9800pS3ylXvEKyPXmAosEYyPfq9qLkRoBEUSgZ7gf0oAONlNQry4i6vgRNas2Uibx_xZ-1apQWHv6_Np7jZNyfETKOGLHQgJeIzfk2NvSU0DZdelK9J0kcNv41wl" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Moreover, check the house's design and orientation.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The method for finding the facing direction of an apartment is the same as a house, which is to find the Yang side. But unlike houses, condo type apartments usually have the Yang side on their balcony because most air, sunlight, and active energy comes from this direction. Also, always take the design and orientation into consideration.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h1>How to use a compass to determine my house's Feng Shui direction?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Now that you know the facing direction of your house, you can proceed to take its compass measurement. But before you continue, you must first:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Remove all jewelry on hands and wrists as well as any metallic belt buckles.</li><li>Stand away from cars or large metal objects such as motor vehicles.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Doing these steps in prior will prevent any magnetic interference you might encounter, preventing you from getting an accurate measurement.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Now, here are the steps in making your first measurement.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1. Go to the facing direction of your home. If your front door happens to be in-line with your house's facing direction, go outside and stand a few feet away from your front door and facing away from it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2. Make sure your back is squared to the property facing away from the door.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3. Hold your compass on your palm and keep it at waist level.</p><p></p><p></p><p>4. Rotate the compass dial until the red compass needle aligns with north</p><p></p><p></p><p>5. Read the compass degree on the indicator line.</p><p></p><p></p><p>6. Write down your reading.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can do this 3-5 times, moving from the leftmost end of your facing direction to the rightmost end. Write down each reading and add them up. Then, divide your total by how many readings you did.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Example: </strong>156 + 160 + 158 = 474 – Divide 468 by 3 equals: 158.</p><p></p><p></p><p>158 degrees South East is the compass measurement of your house facing direction.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h1>How to use a Chinese compass?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>The Chinese Feng Shui compass or the Luo Pan is typically used by experienced feng shui practitioners and masters. The Luo Pan contains lots of information (formulas) regarding its functions.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Luo Pan can look a bit intimidating when you first see it, but it's actually easy to use for basic Feng Shui. If you're interested in using a Chinese compass, you can follow these simple steps on how to use the Chinese compass.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> One important thing to take note when using a Luo Pan - <strong>Always hold it firmly</strong>.</p><p></p><p></p><h2><strong>Step 1:</strong> Hold the Luo Pan Close to Your Body</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Standing firm and balance the Luo Pan on your hands. Always keep it level by checking the leveler part. You can see it in the corner. Keep the bubbles steady in the middle of the two lines horizontally and vertically. The bubbles should remain within the borders.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/5/08ZUbIMTJo5ZIZO5fdOAK0ye5w6uaW__TM7PVIArXRo1deoSEPw_6x0tjuB7CDbIZxy9N0YELO0Fm9mtBYNiqM41nvRVX_QdMeUUb4jlEUDE7yUhNDypqDnfINelgrySvNzKWfU-" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Hold Luo Pan close to your body, preferably at waist (or navel) level. Imagine yourself being an anchor and main point while taking the measurement.</p><p></p><p></p><h2><strong>Step 2:</strong> Adjust the Metal Plate</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/5/pr4b-6WhaIymRKX6epPyWg9LMPYeFjr0A5ba1MTBfpnaxhYRxYQ57NFmrmTV-KvwYGZwEHDgcRjcUNxmwbnf_cwnOLh5jhbq_DV3HyB_GU-kQvZ1UcEqrJwzUJkfxyAv6XPB8WHW" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Luo Pan has two main parts, the square wooden pan, and the rotating metal plate. In the center of the metal plate lies the compass part. Wait until the needle stops moving and adjust the line on the compass and rotate the metal plate to meet the needle until they align perfectly.</p><p></p><p></p><p>While rotating the metal plate, make sure you don't touch the two strings' guarding' the plate. These strings will help you to determine the main 4 directions of the measurement you took. The strings are positioned exactly perpendicularly to each other. Once you get the facing direction degree, you'll instantly know the other main 3 directions: the back, the right side, and the left side.</p><p></p><p></p><h2><strong>Step 3:</strong> Read the directions</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The strings that are 'guarding' the Luo Pan will help you determine the degree of the directions. Check carefully if the string shows a precise degree. If the directions fall between 2 degrees (for example 310' and 311') and you're uncertain about which one is correct, just check the alignment of the line and the needle again.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For beginners, chances are since you are not used to using Luo Pan, there could be a miss regarding the alignment. It still goes down to more practice.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Activate luck using your compass readings</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Now that you've determined the right measurement of your house facing direction, you can now use it to define the Bagua.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/5/cltwmPXFd66193hiloM_FMBXXS88D-gQPKJDrwh72nUq-51T6N5pLSN0tiwbDMzfFgWmth3pU9Hp1w9QDkeRqeRpAwNn-USPRfrF1UFJlcSNQQ9z-Aqe00KBAdCv1mpBNhiLzABt" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>The Bagua is a powerful tool used by feng shui practitioners to improve the energy in a home.
