Well, it could be because of the wrong mattress or lousy air conditioning. But it may not be because of that too.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What if we tell you that your bed placement can actually affect the quality of your sleep?</p><p></p><p></p><p>According to <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/index.php/2020/08/12/feng-shui-basics-attracting-positive-energy-into-your-home/">Feng Shui</a>, having the proper bed placement can help improve your life, including your luck! In this article, we'll talk about how to have an appropriate bed placement in Feng Shui that could bring you good fortune and a good night's sleep.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Why is the proper bed placement important?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>If you want to apply the Feng Shui practice in your <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/index.php/2020/08/12/how-to-feng-shui-your-bedroom/">bedroom</a>, you must first start with the bed placement. Having a proper bed placement is crucial for a few reasons:</p><p></p><p></p><h2>1. Your bed is the most vital piece of furniture in your bedroom.</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Your bed represents you as the occupant of the room. Your bed is probably the one piece of furniture you spend most of your time in. You sleep in it, which is already an average of 6-8 hours per day, more so when you're randomly lying on your bed during the day.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>When you're asleep, you're in a passive "yin" state and are more susceptible to the energies around you. So your bed placement does affect you both in your conscious and unconscious states.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>2. It affects the flow of chi energy</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The flow of chi energy is crucial in space. If you want the optimum flow of chi, you should place your bed correctly to avoid disruption of the energy flow.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Feng Shui bed placements according to Kua number</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Your ideal Feng Shui bed placement depends on your Kua number. Your <strong>Kua number</strong> is used to determine your favorable directions and locations for your home's essential areas, such as your bedroom.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>How to get your Kua number?</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The Kua number (also known as Gua number) is based on the Chinese solar calendar, which is different from the western calendar. The Chinese solar calendar ends on February 5. Therefore if you're born before February 5 (on a western calendar), you should deduct a year from your birth year.</p><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/9/5IOMDUz3syd3veuGFngwWr2gctfgry_BoMX408nJbF4m4P5F1Us5gv9o4z4p-YxRt5YJ6SkJyrQR-PTD_c81o5qUwpUghBHZ1wYKuzqacWhffAIewcR01N36L4OJZxU0ZVfTH-Bi" alt=""></figure></div><p></p><p></p><p>For example, suppose your birth date is February 2, 1960, calculate your Kua number in 1959. But if your birth date is February 6, 1960, you can calculate your Kua number as 1960.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>To calculate your Kua number, you can follow these steps:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Take the last two digits of birth year and add them. (<em>Example:</em> take 5 and 9 from 1959. 5+9=14)</li><li>Add the sum again and continue until you get a single-digit number. (<em>Example:</em> 14 will be 1+4=5)</li><li>For <strong>women</strong>, add 5 to your sum. (<em>Example:</em> 5 was you sum, add 5. 5+5=10)</li><li>For <strong>men</strong>, subtract your sum from 10 (<em>Example:</em> 5 was your sum, subtract that 5 from 10. 10-5=5).</li><li>If you get a two-digit sum/difference, add the digits until you get a single-digit number. (<em>Example:</em> From the women's calculation, you got 10 as a sum. Add these two numbers. 1+0=1. From the men's calculation, you got 5 as a difference. Since it's already a single-digit number, that will be your Kua number.)</li><li>That final single digit is your Kua number.&nbsp;</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>If you're confused about the calculation, you can also use this <a href="https://redlotusletter.com/resources/kua-calculator/">calculator</a> to check what your Kua number is.</p><p></p><p></p><p>After knowing your Kua number, you can now map out your bedroom. Next, divide the floor plan of your bedroom according to the eight cardinal directions. You can now locate which direction works best for you depending on what you’re aiming for. Whether it may be for success, love, health, or personal growth.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Take note of your lucky and unlucky locations, and be careful about placing objects in that area, especially your bed.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Lucky Directions</h3><p></p><p></p><p>Here are the suggested lucky areas according to your Kua number:</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Kua Number</strong></td><td><strong>Money and Success</strong></td><td><strong>Health and Vitality</strong></td><td><strong>Love and Marriage</strong></td><td><strong>Personal Growth</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Southeast</td><td>East</td><td>South</td><td>North</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Northeast</td><td>West</td><td>Northwest</td><td>Southwest</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>South</td><td>North</td><td>Southeast&nbsp;</td><td>East</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>North</td><td>South</td><td>East</td><td>Southeast&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>5 (male)</td><td>Northeast&nbsp;</td><td>West</td><td>Northwest&nbsp;</td><td>Southwest&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>5 (female)</td><td>Southwest&nbsp;</td><td>Northwest&nbsp;</td><td>West</td><td>Northeast&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>West</td><td>Northeast&nbsp;</td><td>Southwest&nbsp;</td><td>Northwest&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Northwest&nbsp;</td><td>Southwest&nbsp;</td><td>Northeast&nbsp;</td><td>West</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Southwest&nbsp;</td><td>Northwest</td><td>West</td><td>Northeast&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>East</td><td>Southeast&nbsp;</td><td>North</td><td>South</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p></p><p></p><h1>Ideal Feng Shui bed placement</h1><p></p><p></p><p>You should aim to make the most auspicious bed placement. Here are some tips on making the ideal Feng Shui bed placement.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>1. Follow the commanding position</h2><p></p><p></p><p>In Feng Shui, there's a principle called a commanding position. It suggests that when you're lying on your bed, you should be able to see the door. However, you should avoid placing your bed directly in line with the door. A good rule of thumb is to place the bed diagonally from the door.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>2. Headboard Against a Solid Wall</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/9/RGwdCxLDjKIjoAaRq2ZxQ1BPIyvmEaKp-daBhH5HQ6WdiiGvJL87TnQGPmws8hdx0EaPsXPJ6WVku9uwgghQWJw23nhLPMsm-Nza9vDED26MUFoinaY-ThSSfpuFqsqXJLWa8cgo" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Your bed's headboard should be securely placed against a solid wall. This means you are supported from the back and can prevent any sense of movement behind you.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>3. Stay away from a toilet wall</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Avoid placing your headboard against a toilet wall or a wall with a toilet on the other side. It's because the bathroom is considered as the room that contains the most filth, and it also generates sewage and flushing toilet bowl water noises. These could affect one's health if your head is orientated towards the bathroom.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>4. Put some space on both sides of the bed</h2><p></p><p></p><p>It's best if you have spaces on both sides of your bed, especially for adults. The area on both sides allows a balance of your yin and yang, feminine and masculine, and space for each partner (or future partner).</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Feng Shui bed placements to avoid</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Aside from getting that ideal placement, there are also positions you must avoid. These include the following:</p><p></p><p></p><h2>1. Avoid direct door facing of the bed</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Avoid positioning your bed directly in front of a door or having your feet pointing straight out the door. This is also referred to as the "coffin position." In Feng Shui, having a door open directly in front of your bed may result in having health problems.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/9/c_Yfp9ufVDtuktCXowezyiNmKWHa99WoDTP3MAnCJ9U2bax7bsAzUtZl-nZ4DDNybdLJTd7T70l6e5_8_HYOTrmi3dod1F6bdYZ6SIrUuN0K2PnUHUYQlBN1guLiyYlvHrxcpqFy" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>If you don't have other choices but to put your bed directly opposite the door, consider putting a room divider or screen to create a false wall.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>2. Avoid an empty space between your headboard and a wall.</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Putting a pace between your headboard and a wall defeats its purpose of providing security. You should avoid diagonal placements, where it forms an empty triangular space when viewed from above.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>3. Avoid lying under a beam, sloped ceiling or ceiling fan</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/9/vYskfHqjZcCOCPE5_HBdXzDthUx8RahzmTAtJJB1ewjGGjnjBqDZ_CBKSir3JYoYA_PrhN4RVw3lTLvEe9fdN1zYf_cHfu5o2A4n85-MEolhPYguE32Di2t9YbUdXH4jIPJ_NI9I" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Avoid lying under these objects as you may develop ailments such as body aches, pains, and headaches. When there is a beam over the center of a marital bed, the couple will have arguments, and the relationship could end in a divorce.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you can't do this, hang two flutes with red ribbons angled, so the open ends are pointed up. This will break the beam's cutting effect and allow the chi to flow into the flutes and then up and away from you.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>4. Avoid sharp corners pointing on your bed</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Avoid sharp corners most commonly found in sharp edges of furniture or beams, or wall corners that jut into the room. This will direct a piercing, stabbing type of energy, aimed directly at the sleeper. Reposition or cover objects that create poison arrows, if possible.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When you can't do this, hang a faceted crystal in front of the point to soften its sharp energy.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>5. Avoid positioning your bed under a window</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Putting your bed under a window could result in absorbing the chi entering through the window. Thus, disrupting your sleep. Likewise, don't block a window with your bed in front of it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you don't have other options but to do this, choose a high bed with a solid headboard that lends the support of a wall.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Which bed placement rule should you use?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Many people get confused about the ideal placement, especially when you consider everything mentioned above. It's almost impossible to apply every single one of it, especially when your room is small.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Here are the most common confusing scenarios people encounter:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Choosing between ideal bed placements and placements to avoid</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>This happens when you place your bed in an ideal position based on your Kua number, but it also happens to be in a location where you should avoid it. Like being directly under a window, for example.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/9/KMVRjGcxqivIzDUCKdzCciCnUihwZXE3JVCpJp81orrzztDs7BjC6cOou6blYUfM2zQFlQkMZsY9yL5nt70Cc7J9lLNoTo-SyDa-uiZF2JMESww5yYVmkQvJuJTwqQDxYXJgZMXy" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>When this happens, You could either give up your ideal position or use other objects to contradict the "must avoid" locations. In this case, you can use a bed with a solid headboard.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Your bed is placed in both lucky and unlucky areas.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>If your bedroom is small, there's a big chance that the bed takes up most of the space in it. It may cover even the afflicted areas of your room based on your Kua number. When this happens, just prioritize the head part of the bed and make sure it's placed in your lucky area.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Choosing between two ideal positions</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Suppose you are a couple, and you both have different Kua numbers. Now, whose Kua number should you follow? When this happens, consider following the <strong>female's Kua number</strong>. It's because both the bedroom and the female belong to Yin (using the Yin Yang theory). For this reason, the female's Kua is the priority in bed placement.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Find the right bed placement for you</h1><p></p><p></p><p>You see, there are numerous variations, cures, and conflicts, for proper Feng Shui bed placement. Don't overdo it to the point where everything feels uncomfortable. Just look for what's best for you. The most crucial part is making your bedroom cozy and comfortable so you can get the most out of it.&nbsp;</p><p></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__inner post__footer-inner"><div class="post__updated">Updated: <time datetime="2022-08-28T18:53">August 28, 2022</time></div><div class="post__actions"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button" aria-label="Share"><svg width="32" height="32"><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Feng%20Shui%20Bed%20Placement%3A%20Tips%20for%20Good%20Luck https%3A%2F%2Fchrisgliddon.github.io%2Fluckycathome%2Ffeng-shui-bed-placement-tips-for-good-luck%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> WhatsApp</a></div></div></div></div><div class="post__inner author post__author"><div class="author__info"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/authors/melbren/" class="invert author__name" rel="author">Melbren</a></div></div></footer></article></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/what-is-my-feng-shui-element/" rel="prev" class="post__nav-link"><span>Previous</span><h5 class="invert">What is My Feng Shui Element?</h5></a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/3-easy-ways-to-find-your-feng-shui-wealth-corner/" rel="next" class="post__nav-link"><span>Next</span><h5 class="invert">3 Easy Ways to Find Your Feng Shui Wealth Corner</h5></a></div></div></div></nav><div class="section section--light s-t-2 s-b-2 post__related"><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="h6 section__title">You may also like:</h3><div class="feed"><div class="feed post__related-feed"><div class="feed__item"><div class="feed__text"><h3 class="h5"><a href="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/kua-number-calculator-how-to-find-your-feng-shui-kua-number/" class="invert">Kua Number Calculator: How to Find Your Feng Shui Kua Number</a></h3><p>In Feng Shui, there is a fundamental concept known as the "Kua Number".
