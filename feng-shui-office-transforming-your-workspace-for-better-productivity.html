Having a vibrant, well-arranged office can actually help become more productive. And you can achieve more with that with the help of Feng Shui.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If you want to transform your office to achieve a more stress-free and productive environment, here are some useful tips on how to change and Feng Shui your office for better productivity.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>How to feng shui your office?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Many people mistake <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/index.php/2020/08/12/feng-shui-basics-attracting-positive-energy-into-your-home/">Feng Shui</a> for a "Chinese" style of decorating. Although the practice of Feng Shui involves decoration, it's not just about that. Feng Shui is more of the science and art of attracting positive energy (chi) into your space, making it more pleasant and positive for you overall.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can apply Feng Shui in almost any space, and that includes your office. There are a lot of ways to Feng Shui in an office. It still largely depends on your personality and preference as the occupant. However, there are essential points on how and where to apply Feng Shui they are:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Your office layout</li><li>Your desk's position</li><li>Your office decor</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>We will elaborate more on these points later.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Feng Shui Office Bagua map</h1><p></p><p></p><p>The Feng Shui Bagua (also known as pakua) is one of the primary tools used in Feng Shui. You can use the Bagua to analyze the energy of a space, be it at home, garden, or office. The Bagua serves as the Feng Shui energy map of your space and shows you which areas of your space are connected to certain areas of your life.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>How to map your office using a Bagua</h2><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/15/eL3TVtW70sNjMOGm84bKzKuzAi-f_pUeFbEVQqcHCPAUSNBb89adUMk8aLu9SloXy2nGl7UN5GE2XAth90W2NSPxfaqAp0a8MKINGYv5DfgIR_oVxcyOYYZ5fLnK_UAqggCQf6-w" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>The traditional Bagua has nine sides. Each side corresponds to a specific area of your life which include:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Abundance and prosperity</li><li>Fame and reputation</li><li>Love and relationship</li><li>Family and community</li><li>Health</li><li>Creativity and children</li><li>Wisdom</li><li>Career life and purpose</li><li>Helpful people and travel</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>To map out your office, you may need to use a <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/index.php/2020/08/12/how-to-use-a-feng-shui-compass/">compass</a> to know the right-facing direction of your office. Knowing what direction will help you align the side of the Bagua properly.</p><p></p><p></p><p>After mapping out the sections, you should ask yourself which parts of your life and/or business you'd want to focus on. For example, you'd want to enhance your career. You can locate where the career section is in the Bagua, and you may want to put an item that could help amplify the energy in that area.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>Which direction should your office desk face?</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Like what we mentioned earlier, the position of your desk is a vital part of practicing Feng Shui in your office. Here's how you can position your desk the right way.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>1. Place your desk in a command position.</h2><p></p><p></p><p>The command position is where your desk is facing the doorway. You should be able to see who's coming in and out of your office. You can put your desk vertically, horizontally, or diagonally depending on your space.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/15/KhEgr9Nt7YHZi_kiCVEUrtKyL-EEeoyTzr65ee2QfBqnnqBniHbz2S39sIVux-7YSvzXv3HVl-wbz9_SgrHh_1bt7z76qgGSQvSxduPEXhZyiLXKg4UnRR0Slt3n-MJV5IorAiGx" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>But keep in mind that your desk shouldn't be directly in line with the door. You should be able to see the door, but it shouldn't be directly in front of you. This could give off negative energy which you wouldn't want in your office.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>2. Desk facing wall</h2><p></p><p></p><p>This is the position you should avoid when positioning your desk. A desk that facing a wall has an inherent bad energy flow in Feng Shui. It also symbolizes obstacles, which get in the way of your productivity. Moreover, it can make you feel less motivated and less inspired because there's no beautiful view in front of you.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>3. Back against a window</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Another position to avoid is having a window against your back. This also promotes negative energy flow in Feng Shui. Having your back against a window could mean that negative energy would stab you in the back.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>4. Back against a wall</h2><p></p><p></p><p>In Feng Shui, you should always have something solid and stable behind you. And a wall is a perfect example. This will provide you with stability, which is the best for career support. If you can't put your desk chair against a wall, you can also use office chairs with high backrest.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>5. Face your lucky direction</h2><p></p><p></p><p>You can also use your lucky direction to position your desk. You can determine this by finding your Kua number. You can use this <a href="https://www.wofs.com/kua-number-calculator/">Kua calculator</a> to find your Kua number.</p><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/15/iX6Zm5kkZEZB5IEFPvNGJv4ixrw5Zx2gzDQnHfj-9JQwgxyJ8leHatOgHOr8y9TclXhOqXvZAethMBkY4jJi-poFOBmwObGYGddCIBX8zCcd71wbLK9bDmIajgcwl34nAjOIYAtt" alt=""></figure></div><p></p><p></p><p>North, East, South, and Southeast are good for those who have Kua numbers 9, 4, 3, and 1</p><p></p><p></p><p>West, Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest are good for those who have Kua numbers 8, 7, 6, and 2</p><p></p><p></p><p>For those who have Kua number 5, it is the same as Kua number 2 for males and Kua number 8 for females.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can also utilize your Kua number to determine your lucky <a href="https://www.luckycathome.com/index.php/2020/08/12/what-is-my-feng-shui-element/">element</a>, which you can use to decorate your office.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h2>6. Choose the right desk</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Aside from choosing the right position, selecting the right desk is also essential. Choose one that has enough space for all your essentials. A rectangular one (with rounded edges) is good. You can also go for a curved desk, but make sure you're sitting inside the curve, so the positive energy will towards you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Don't choose brightly colored desks, too, as it could make you feel restless and uneasy.</p><p></p><p></p><h1>How to arrange Feng Shui office furniture?</h1><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrisgliddon.github.io/luckycathome/media/posts/15/-N-D4cPDTZJWW7xc7cVArP7TZa1hgEPLSBmpfiRmYr8XA6X9DpY8eWlUv7hgd6Yt9dydiGYD1Pr4ihfqpsw-beyudK4jsNTxCo70dToLWpoPk3GqbAgWq0Nj7H4-6MEyALDBXN3c" alt=""></figure><p></p><p></p><p>We've talked about the proper placement of the main furniture in your office, which is your desk.
